Isaac for Manipulation Tutorials with Isaac Sim
===============================================================

Overview
--------

The Isaac for Manipulation tutorials with Isaac Sim demonstrate GPU-accelerated manipulation workflows 
in a simulated environment. These tutorials cover a range of manipulation capabilities from basic 
motion planning to complex assembly tasks.

All tutorials leverage:

- :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS cuMotion <isaac_ros_cumotion>` for optimal-time, collision-free trajectory generation
- Isaac Sim for high-fidelity robot simulation
- Perfect ground truth depth from simulation for accurate obstacle detection
- Rectified image streams that eliminate the need for lens distortion correction

Available Tutorials
-------------------

Basic Motion Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   isaac_sim/tutorial_isaac_sim_pose_to_pose

Start here to learn basic obstacle-aware motion planning. The robot moves between two predetermined 
poses while avoiding obstacles in the workspace.

Perception-Based Manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   isaac_sim/tutorial_isaac_sim_object_following

Learn how to use perception models (FoundationPose or DOPE) to track and follow objects in real-time 
while avoiding obstacles.

Complete Pick and Place Workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   isaac_sim/tutorial_isaac_sim_pick_and_place
   isaac_sim/tutorial_isaac_sim_grasp_authoring

Implement a full pick and place pipeline that combines perception, grasping, and motion planning 
to manipulate objects. Learn how to author custom grasps for improved reliability.
