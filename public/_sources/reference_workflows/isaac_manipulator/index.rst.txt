Isaac Manipulator
=================

`Isaac Manipulator` is a collection of GPU-accelerated packages for perception-driven manipulation, providing capabilities
such as object detection, pose estimation, and time-optimal collision-free motion generation using
:ref:`cuMotion <concept-cumotion>`.  These packages are distributed in individual repositories as part of
Isaac ROS in order to maximize reuse and flexibility.

The `Isaac Manipulator` repository contains reference workflows that currently leverage the following Isaac packages:

* :doc:`Isaac ROS cuMotion </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_cumotion/index>` for optimal-time, collision-free
  trajectory generation.
* :doc:`Isaac ROS nvblox </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/index>` for local 3D reconstruction and obstacle
  detection.
* :doc:`Isaac ROS DNN Stereo Depth </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_dnn_stereo_depth/index>` for
  learning-based stereo depth estimation.

Many deployments would also benefit from one or more of the following Isaac packages:

* :doc:`Isaac ROS Object Detection </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_object_detection/index>` for detecting objects
  using SyntheticaDETR trained models.
* :doc:`Isaac ROS Pose Estimation </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_pose_estimation/index>` for estimating the pose
  of objects using FoundationPose.
* :doc:`Isaac ROS Nova </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nova/index>` for time-synchronized multi-camera data.
* :doc:`Isaac ROS Image Pipeline </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_image_pipeline/index>` for GPU-accelerated image
  processing.
