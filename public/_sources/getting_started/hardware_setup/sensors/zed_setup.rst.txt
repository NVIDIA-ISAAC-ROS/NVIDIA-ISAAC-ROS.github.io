ZED cameras require the following to be able to publish data to ROS 2 topics:

1. ZED SDK (Installed by ``Dockerfile.zed``)
2. ``zed-ros2-wrapper`` (Cloned in Step 1 of Setup Instructions)
3. ZED X driver (Installed by user on host machine in Step 3 of Setup Instructions)

Camera Compatibility
--------------------

All cameras supported by the `zed ros2 wrapper <https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper>`_ work with Isaac ROS.

Setup Instructions
------------------

.. note::

  This tutorial assumes that you have set up your development environment by following the instructions :doc:`here </getting_started/dev_env_setup>`.

1. Clone the ``isaac_ros_common`` and ``zed-ros2-wrapper`` repositories:

  .. code:: bash

      cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src && \
      git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common && \
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper

  .. note::
    ``${ISAAC_ROS_WS}`` is defined to point to ``/ssd/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/`` or ``~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/``.

2. If you are using ZED X or ZED X Mini refer to the appropriate `stereolabs setup guide <https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/get-started-with-zed-x/>`_.

  .. note::
    You do **not** need to install the ``ZED SDK`` because this is done by ``Dockerfile.zed``.

  .. note::
    You must install the ``ZED driver``.


3. Plug in the USB cable of your ZED camera before launching the Docker container in the next step.

4. Configure the container created by ``isaac_ros_common/scripts/run_dev.sh`` to include ``Dockerfile.zed``. Create the ``.isaac_ros_common-config`` file in the ``isaac_ros_common/scripts`` directory:

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common/scripts && \
    touch .isaac_ros_common-config && \
    echo CONFIG_IMAGE_KEY=ros2_humble.user.zed >> .isaac_ros_common-config

5. Launch the Docker container.

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common && \
    ./scripts/run_dev.sh ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}

  This rebuilds the container image using ``Dockerfile.zed`` in one of its layered stage. It takes some time for rebuilding.

6. After the container image is rebuilt and you are inside the container, you can run ``/usr/local/zed/tools/ZED_Explorer`` to check that the ZED camera is connected.

  .. code:: bash

    /usr/local/zed/tools/ZED_Explorer

  If everything is working as expected, you should see something similar to the following:
