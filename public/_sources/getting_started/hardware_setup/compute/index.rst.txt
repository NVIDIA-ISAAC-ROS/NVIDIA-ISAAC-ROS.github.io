x86 Platforms
-------------

1. Prepare a NVIDIA-powered platform with the following minimum specs:

   -  Ubuntu 22.04+

      -  **Experimental**: WSL2 on Windows 11

   -  16 GB general RAM
   -  Discrete NVIDIA GPU with the following specs:

      -  supports CUDA 12.2+ with Volta or newer
      -  minimum 8GB of VRAM and recommended 12GB+
      
      .. note::

         Various DNN models when loaded together can consume more memory than you may have available.

2. Install Docker from official instructions (`here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository>`__)

3. Install the latest NVIDIA GPU Driver from official instructions (`here <https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/nvidia-drivers-installation>`__)

Jetson Platforms
----------------

1. `Install Jetpack <https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/jetpack/install-setup/index.html>`__ including the ``nvidia-container`` package.

2. After boot, confirm that you have installed the correct version of ``Jetpack`` by
   running the following command. Confirm that the output has the terms
   ``R36 (release), REVISION: 3.0``.

   .. code:: bash

      cat /etc/nv_tegra_release

3. Run the following command to set the GPU and CPU clock to max. See
   `Maximizing Jetson
   Performance <https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.1/DeveloperGuide/text/SD/PlatformPowerAndPerformance/JetsonOrinNxSeriesAndJetsonAgxOrinSeries.html?highlight=maxn#maximizing-jetson-orin-performance>`__
   for more details.

   .. code:: bash

      sudo /usr/bin/jetson_clocks

4. Run the following command to set the to power to MAX settings. See
   `Power Mode
   Controls <https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.1/DeveloperGuide/text/SD/PlatformPowerAndPerformance/JetsonOrinNxSeriesAndJetsonAgxOrinSeries.html?highlight=maxn#power-mode-controls>`__
   for more details.

   .. code:: bash

      sudo /usr/sbin/nvpmodel -m 0

5. Add your user to the ``docker`` group.

   .. code:: bash
      
      sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
      newgrp docker

6. Setup Docker.

   .. include:: /_snippets/docker_buildx.rst


Consider adding more storage to your Jetson for a better experience: :doc:`Developer Environment Setup for Jetson <jetson_storage>`
