===============
Getting Started
===============

The Isaac ROS suite has been developed and released by NVIDIA to
leverage the power of NVIDIA acceleration on NVIDIA Jetson and
discrete GPUs for standard robotics applications.

Isaac ROS uses standard ROS interfaces on input and output topics, making
it extremely easy to use as a drop-in replacement for commonly-used, CPU-based ROS
implementations familiar to robotics developers.


System Requirements

ROS Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

All Isaac ROS packages are designed and tested to be compatible with `ROS 2
Humble <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`__.

If your application is build with `ROS 1 Noetic <https://wiki.ros.org/noetic>`__, you can integrate Isaac ROS packages with
accelerated performance using the  :doc:`Isaac ROS NITROS Bridge </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nitros_bridge/index>`.

.. warning::

   ROS 1 Noetic is not supported in the same OS environment as ROS 2 Humble.

.. warning::

   Isaac ROS packages have **ONLY** been tested against ROS 2 Humble. Other ROS 2
   versions are **NOT YET** supported.

Follow steps below to set up a ROS 2 developer environment with Isaac ROS Dev Docker images. Alternatively, you can also install pre-built ROS 2 Humble packages through the :doc:`Isaac Apt Repository <isaac_apt_repository>`.

.. note::

   We **strongly** recommend that you set up your :doc:`developer environment <dev_env_setup>` with Isaac ROS Dev Docker images.
   This will streamline your development environment setup with the correct versions of dependencies on both Jetson and x86_64 platforms.
   Working within the Isaac ROS Dev Docker containers will setup ROS and automatically configure the :doc:`Isaac Apt Repository <isaac_apt_repository>`.


Setup
-----

1. Set up the hardware to run Isaac ROS:

* :doc:`Compute Setup <hardware_setup/compute/index>`
* :doc:`Sensors Setup <hardware_setup/sensors/index>`


.. note::

   If you do not have access to physical sensors but still want to try out Isaac ROS packages, you can check out
   our :doc:`Isaac Sim guide </getting_started/isaac_sim/index>` for setting up the simulation environment.


2. Set up the developer environment for Isaac ROS:

* :doc:`Developer Environment Setup <dev_env_setup>`


.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 2

   hardware_setup/index.rst
   dev_env_setup.rst
   isaac_sim/index.rst

Once you are set up, check out the :doc:`Repositories and Packages </repositories_and_packages/index>` to start running
Isaac ROS packages!


Isaac Sim Tutorials
-------------------

Isaac ROS packages are also designed to work with `Isaac Sim <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim>`__, which is NVIDIA's
robotics simulation platform powered by Omniverse. A number of tutorials are provided to learn how to use Isaac Sim
with Isaac ROS.
