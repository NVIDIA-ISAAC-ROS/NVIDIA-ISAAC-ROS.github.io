Isaac Sim Setup
===============

`Isaac Sim <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim>`__ is NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform
powered by Omniverse.

Isaac Sim can be used to run and test the ROS2 applications. There are two ways we can configure the system.

- Software in the Loop
- Hardware in the Loop
  
Software in the Loop (SIL) refers to a configuration where the software
being tested is not running on the target hardware platform. For
example, Isaac ROS packages being tested on x86 before deployment on a Jetson device is SIL.

Hardware in the Loop (HIL) refers to a configuration where the software 
is being tested on the target hardware platform. 
For example, Isaac ROS packages being tested on a Jetson device before deployment is HIL.

In both the configurations, Isaac Sim always runs on a ``x86_64`` machine providing sensor data and world information.

1. Install `Isaac Sim <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/requirements.html>`__, choosing the appropriate working environment:

   -  `Native <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html>`__
   -  `Docker <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_container.html>`__
   -  `Cloud <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_cloud.html>`__

   .. note::

      This tutorial assumes the Native environment for Isaac Sim.

2. Follow the `instructions <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html#isaac-sim-setup-native-workstation-launcher>`__
   to launch Isaac Sim App Selector window.

3. Click **Open in Terminal** button. It should open a terminal window and run the following commands.

   .. code:: bash

      export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp && 
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/exts/omni.isaac.ros2_bridge/humble/lib
   
   .. note::

      If you have a native installation of ROS2, you can skip the update to ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable.

   Optionally, if ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` is needed to create a `separate logical network <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Domain-ID.html#overview>`__, run the the following commands.

   .. code:: bash

      export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id>


4. Launch Isaac Sim.

   .. code:: bash

      ./isaac-sim.sh

5. Open Isaac ROS Sample scene as shown below.

6. Continue with the next steps in your specific Isaac ROS package
   tutorial.

   .. note::
      Make sure to set the ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` environment variable (if set earlier) before running the sample application.
