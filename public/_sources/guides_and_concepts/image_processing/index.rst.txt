Image Processing
================

Camera output often needs pre-processing to meet the input
requirements of multiple different perception functions. This can
include cropping, resizing, mirroring, correcting for lens distortion,
and color space conversion. For stereo cameras, additional processing is
required to produce disparity between left + right images and a point
cloud for depth perception.
