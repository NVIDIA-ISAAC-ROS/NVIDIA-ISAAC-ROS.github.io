Example Usage of Isaac ROS Proximity Segmentation
=================================================

This is an example use case of Isaac ROS Proximity Segmentation, which
includes monitoring the forward zones of an autonomous mobile robot
(AMR) using a HAWK stereo camera. Consider three zones in front of the
robot (Zones 1-3), corresponding to different alerts and actions the
robot must take if an object breaches the zone. Zone 3 generates a
warning, Zone 2 sends a signal for the robot to slow, and Zone 1 results
in the robot stopping immediately.


Depending on the velocity of the robot, the distances of the zones may
change. For this example, we use the following distances from the front
of robot to define the zones:

============== =================== ====================== =======================
Robot Velocity Zone 1 (Stop - Red) Zone 2 (Slow - Yellow) Zone 3 (Warning - Blue)
============== =================== ====================== =======================
1 m/s          0.5 m               0.7 m                  4.0 m
2 m/s          2.0 m               4.0 m                  6.0 m
3 m/s          3.5 m               6.0 m                  9.0 m
============== =================== ====================== =======================

The distances for each zone is converted to disparity values using the
following formula:


This example uses a HAWK stereo camera with a baseline of 15 cm and
focal length of 933 px. Thus, the following disparity values are
calculated for each zone:

============== =================== ====================== =======================
Robot Velocity Zone 1 (Stop - Red) Zone 2 (Slow - Yellow) Zone 3 (Warning - Blue)
============== =================== ====================== =======================
1 m/s          280 px              200 px                 46 px
2 m/s          70 px               35 px                  23 px
3 m/s          40 px               23 px                  15 px
============== =================== ====================== =======================

This example uses the Isaac ROS Bi3D package to detect when these zones
are breached. An example is shown in the table below. Pixels in red
indicate that Zone 1 has been breached, yellow indicates Zone 2 has been
breached, and blue indicates Zone 3 has been breached.
