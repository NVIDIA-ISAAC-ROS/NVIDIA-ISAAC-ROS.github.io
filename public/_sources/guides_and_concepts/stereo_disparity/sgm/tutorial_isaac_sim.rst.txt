Tutorial with Isaac Sim
=======================

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform depth-camera based
reconstruction using the ``disparity_node`` and stereo image pairs
streamed from Isaac Sim.

Last validated with `Isaac Sim 2022.2.1 <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/release_notes.html#id1>`__

1. Complete steps 1-4 listed under `Quickstart section </packages/isaac_ros_image_pipeline/isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc/index>`__ in the main README.
2. Install and launch Isaac Sim following the steps in the `Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common/blob/main/docs/isaac-sim-sil-setup.md>`__.
3. Open the Isaac ROS Common USD scene (using the *Content* tab) located
   at:

   .. code:: text

      http://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/2022.2.1/Isaac/Samples/ROS2/Scenario/carter_warehouse_apriltags_worker.usd

   And wait for it to load completely.
4. Go to the *Stage* tab and select
   ``/World/Carter_ROS/ROS_Cameras/ros2_create_camera_right_info``, then
   in *Property* tab *-> OmniGraph Node -> Inputs -> stereoOffset X*
   change ``0`` to ``-175.92``.

   
5. Enable the right camera for a stereo image pair. Go to the *Stage*
   tab and select ``/World/Carter_ROS/ROS_Cameras/enable_camera_right``,
   then tick the *Condition* checkbox.

   
6. Press **Play** to start publishing data from the Isaac Sim
   application.

   
7. In a separate terminal, start the ``isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc``
   graph using the launch files:

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc isaac_ros_stereo_image_pipeline_isaac_sim.launch.py

   You should see a RViz window, as shown below:
