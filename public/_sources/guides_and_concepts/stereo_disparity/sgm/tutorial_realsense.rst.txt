Tutorial With RealSense
=======================

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform depth-camera based
reconstruction using a
`Realsense <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html>`__
camera and
`disparity_node <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_image_pipeline/blob/main/isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc/src/disparity_node.cpp>`__.

.. note::

   This tutorial requires a compatible RealSense camera from
   the list available
   `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/.github/blob/main/profile/realsense-setup.md#camera-compatibility>`__.

1. Complete the `RealSense setup
   tutorial <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/.github/blob/main/profile/realsense-setup.md>`__.

2. Clone the ``isaac_ros_image_pipeline``:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src

   .. code:: bash

      https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_image_pipeline.git

3. Open a new terminal and launch the Docker container using the
   ``run_dev.sh`` script:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/isaac_ros_common && \
        ./scripts/run_dev.sh

4. Build and source the workspace:

   .. code:: bash

      cd /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev && \
        colcon build --symlink-install && \
        source install/setup.bash

5. Run the launch file, which launches the example, and wait for 10
   seconds.

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc isaac_ros_stereo_image_pipeline.launch.py

Here is a screenshot of the result from running the example:
