CenterPose
=========================

The `CenterPose <https://github.com/NVlabs/CenterPose>`__ DNN performs
object detection on the image, generates 2D keypoints for the object,
estimates the 6-DoF pose, and regresses relative 3D bounding cuboid
dimensions. This is performed on a known object class without knowing
the instanceâ€“for example, detecting a chair without having trained on
images of all chairs. NVLabs has provided pre-trained models for the
CenterPose model; however, as with the DOPE model, it needs to be
trained with another dataset targeting objects that are specific to your
application.

Pose estimation is a compute-intensive task and not performed at the
frame rate of an input camera. To make efficient use of resources,
object pose is estimated for a single frame and used as an input to
navigation. Additional object pose estimates are computed to further
refine navigation in progress at a lower frequency than the input rate
of a typical camera.
