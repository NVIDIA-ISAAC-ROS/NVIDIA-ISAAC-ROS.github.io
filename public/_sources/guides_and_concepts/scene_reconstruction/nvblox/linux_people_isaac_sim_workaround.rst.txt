Workaround for running People Animation on Linux
================================================

Currently, python scripts for animation can only run if the usd is on
the same filesystem as the script. This means that it is required to
upload the scripts next to where the usd is stored:

1. To retrieve where the scripts are stored, click Window -> Extensions
   and search for ``omni.anim.people``. Then in the extension details
   click on the folder icon. This will open a window in your browser
   showing where the extension is stored.


2. You now need to upload the ``scripts`` folder from the
   ``omni/anim/people`` folder into a ``people_anim_scripts`` folder
   next to the scene usd. To do so, you can right-click on the *Content*
   tab on the bottom then select *Upload files and folders* to upload
   the scripts folder.

3. This step will need to be done each time a new version of the
   extension is released.
