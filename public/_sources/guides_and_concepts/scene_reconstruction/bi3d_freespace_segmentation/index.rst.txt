Bi3D Freespace Segmentation
================================

By processing a freespace segmentation
mask with the pose of the robot relative to the ground, Bi3D Freespace
produces an occupancy grid for
`Nav2 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2>`__, which is used to
avoid obstacles during navigation. This package is GPU accelerated to
provide real-time, low latency results in a robotics application. Bi3D
Freespace provides an additional occupancy grid source for mobile robots
(ground based).


There are multiple methods to predict the occupancy grid as an input to
navigation. None of these methods are perfect; each has limitations on
the accuracy of its estimate from the sensor providing measured
observations. Each sensor has a unique field of view, range to provide
its measured view of the world, and corresponding areas it does not
measure. Bi3D Freespace provides a diverse approach to
identifying obstacles from freespace. Stereo camera input used for this
function is diverse relative to lidar, and has a better vertical field
of view than most lidar units, allowing for perception of low lying
obstacles that lidar can miss. Bi3D Freespace provides a
robust, vision-based complement to lidar occupancy scanning.
