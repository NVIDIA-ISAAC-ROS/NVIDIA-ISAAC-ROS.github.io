Overview
------------

A trained model based on
the `U-NET <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net>`__ architecture is
required to produce a segmentation mask. Input images may need to be
cropped and resized to maintain the aspect ratio and match the input
resolution of the U-NET DNN; image resolution may be reduced to improve
DNN inference performance, which typically scales directly with the
number of pixels in the image. 


Image segmentation provides more information and uses more compute than
object detection to produce classifications per pixel, whereas object
detection classifies a simpler bounding box rectangle in image
coordinates. Object detection is used to know if, and where spatially in
a 2D image, the object exists. Image segmentation is used to know which
pixels belong to the class and, when fused with corresponding depth
information, to know an object location in a 3D scene.
