RealSense Data Recording for Nvblox
===================================

We provide a custom launch file to record RealSense data for playing back with nvblox.

Record ROS Bag
--------------

To record RealSense data for nvblox:

1. Make sure that all :ref:`RealSense Dependencies <nvblox-realsense-dependencies>` are met.

2. Connect the camera, start the docker container and source the
   workspace as explained in the :doc:`tutorial_realsense`.

3. Start recording:

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup record_realsense.launch.py

4. Stop the recording when done.

Start Nvblox from ROS Bag
-------------------------

1. Setup your workspace for the RealSense example you wish to run
   (:doc:`static <tutorial_realsense>`,
   :doc:`human <tutorial_human_reconstruction_realsense>` or
   :doc:`dynamic <tutorial_dynamic_reconstruction_realsense>` reconstruction).

2. Inside the sourced ROS Docker container start nvblox from a bag:

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup <launch_file_name_of_example>.launch.py from_bag:=True bag_path:=<path_to_recorded_bag>
