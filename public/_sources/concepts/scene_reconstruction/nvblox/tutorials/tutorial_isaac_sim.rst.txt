This tutorial walks you through generating a 3D reconstruction with
nvblox using image and LiDAR data from Isaac Sim. The reconstruction is
displayed as a 3D mesh in RVIZ. Nvblox also converts the reconstruction
into a 2D costmap, which is fed into the Nav2 stack for path planning.

Tutorial Walkthrough
--------------------

1. Complete the 
   :doc:`Nvblox Quickstart </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/index>`.

2. Install Isaac Sim,
   open the Isaac Sim terminal and export the needed environment variables 
   as explained in steps 1-3 of the :doc:`Isaac Sim Setup Guide </getting_started/isaac_sim/index>`.

3. Start the simulation by running the below command in the terminal opened in the previous step:

   .. code:: bash

      ./python.sh ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/isaac_ros_nvblox/nvblox_examples/nvblox_isaac_sim/omniverse_scripts/start_isaac_sim.py --gpu_physics_enabled

   .. note::

      The ``start_isaac_sim`` script is explained in detail
      :ir_repo:`here <isaac_ros_nvblox> <nvblox_examples/nvblox_isaac_sim/omniverse_scripts/README.md>`.

4. *In another terminal* launch the Docker container using the ``run_dev.sh`` script:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/isaac_ros_common && \
        ./scripts/run_dev.sh

5.  Inside the container, build and source the workspace:

    .. code:: bash

       cd /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev && \
         colcon build --symlink-install && \
         source install/setup.bash

6. Launch the pre-composed graph launch file:

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup isaac_sim_example.launch.py

7. Click on the **2D Goal Pose** button. You should see the mesh and
   costmap, as well as the robot moving towards the goal location, as
   shown at the top of this page.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Refer to the
:doc:`/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/troubleshooting/troubleshooting_nvblox_isaac_sim`.
