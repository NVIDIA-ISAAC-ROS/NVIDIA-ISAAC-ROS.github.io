=======

`RT-DETR <https://github.com/lyuwenyu/RT-DETR>`__ (Real-Time Detection Transformer) 
is a popular object detection model that excels in both detection quality and speed.

Inspired by RT-DETR, NVIDIA has also developed a new category of
:ir_ngc:`SyntheticaDETR <teams/isaac/models/synthetica_detr>`
models that are trained exclusively on synthetically generated data
rendered with Omniverse technology.
