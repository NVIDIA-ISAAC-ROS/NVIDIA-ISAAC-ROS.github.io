Segmentation refers to the process of labeling every point in an object with a semantic label. In the case of images, this specifically refers to 
labeling every pixel within the image with a label. Intuitively, it can be thought of as providing a classification of an input image at the pixel level
for a given set of known classes. 

Image segmentation and object detection are closely linked. Image segmentation typically provides more information, but uses
more compute compared to object detection due to the requirement of producing labeling every pixel. Object detection produces
a simple bounding box in image coordinate. This is useful to know if, and where, an object exists spatially in a 2D image. 
On the other hand, image segmentation is used to know which pixels belong to the class. 
One use case is fusing the segmentation mask produced by a segmentation network with the corresponding depth
information, to know an object location in a 3D scene.
