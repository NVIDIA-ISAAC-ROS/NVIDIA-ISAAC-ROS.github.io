Tutorial With RealSense
=======================

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform depth-camera based
reconstruction using a
`Realsense <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html>`__
camera and
:ir_repo:`disparity_node <isaac_ros_image_pipeline> <isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc/src/disparity_node.cpp>`.

.. note::

   This tutorial requires a compatible RealSense camera from
   the list of available
   :doc:`cameras </getting_started/hardware_setup/sensors/realsense_setup>`.

1. Complete the :doc:`RealSense Setup Tutorial </getting_started/hardware_setup/sensors/realsense_setup>`.

2. Open a new terminal and launch the Docker container using the
   ``run_dev.sh`` script:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common && \
        ./scripts/run_dev.sh

3. Inside the container, install ``isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc``

   :ir_apt:

   .. code:: bash

      sudo apt-get install -y ros-humble-isaac-ros-stereo-image-proc

4. Run the launch file, which launches the example, and wait for 10
   seconds.

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch isaac_ros_stereo_image_proc isaac_ros_stereo_image_pipeline_realsense.launch.py

Here is a screenshot of the result from running the example:
