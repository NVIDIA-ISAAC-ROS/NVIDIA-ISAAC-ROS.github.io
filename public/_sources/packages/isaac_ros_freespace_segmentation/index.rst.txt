Overview
--------


Isaac ROS Freespace Segmentation contains an ROS 2 package to produce
occupancy grids for navigation. By processing a freespace segmentation
mask with the pose of the robot relative to the ground, Bi3D Freespace
produces an occupancy grid for
`Nav2 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2>`__, which is used to
avoid obstacles during navigation. This package is GPU accelerated to
provide real-time, low latency results in a robotics application. Bi3D
Freespace provides an additional occupancy grid source for mobile robots
(ground based).


``isaac_ros_bi3d`` is used in a graph of nodes to provide a freespace
segmentation mask as one output from a time-synchronized input left and
right stereo image pair. The freespace mask is used by
``isaac_ros_bi3d_freespace`` with TF pose of the camera relative to the
ground to compute planar freespace into an occupancy grid as input to
`Nav2 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2>`__.
