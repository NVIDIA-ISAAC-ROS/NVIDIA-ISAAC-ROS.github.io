Overview
--------

Isaac ROS DNN Disparity provides a GPU-accelerated package for DNN-based
stereo disparity. Stereo disparity is calculated from a
time-synchronized image pair sourced from a stereo camera and is used to
produce a depth image or a point cloud of a scene. The ``isaac_ros_ess``
package uses the `ESS DNN
model <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/isaac/models/dnn_stereo_disparity>`__
to perform stereo depth estimation via continuous disparity prediction.
Given a pair of stereo input images, the package generates a disparity
map of the left input image.


ESS is used in a graph of nodes to provide a disparity prediction from
an input left and right stereo image pair. Images to ESS need to be
rectified and resized to the appropriate input resolution. The aspect
ratio of the image needs to be maintained, so the image may need to be
cropped and resized to maintain the input aspect ratio. The graph for
DNN encode, to DNN inference, to DNN decode is part of the ESS node.
Inference is performed using TensorRT, as the ESS DNN model is designed
to use optimizations supported by TensorRT.
