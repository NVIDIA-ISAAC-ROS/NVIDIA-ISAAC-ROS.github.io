Overview
--------

Isaac ROS Image Segmentation contains a ROS 2 package to produce semantic image segmentation. ``isaac_ros_unet`` provides a method for classification of an input image at the pixel level, as each pixel is predicted to belong to a set of defined classes. Classification is performed with GPU acceleration running DNN inference on a U-NET architecture model. The output prediction can be used by perception functions to understand where each class is spatially in a 2D image or fuse with a corresponding depth location in a 3D scene.
