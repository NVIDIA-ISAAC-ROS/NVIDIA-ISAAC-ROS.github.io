Overview
--------

This repository provides an H.264 image encoder and decoder that
leverages the specialized hardware in NVIDIA GPUs and the
`Jetson <https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing>`__ platform.
The ``isaac_ros_h264_encoder`` package can compress an image into H.264
data using the NVENC on the Jetson platform. The
``isaac_ros_h264_decoder`` package can decode the H.264 data into
original images using the NVDEC on the Jetson and x86 platform with
NVIDIA GPUs.

Image compression reduces the data footprint of images when written to
storage or transmitted between computers. A 1080p camera at 30fps
produces 177MB/s of data; image compression reduces this by
approximately 10 times to 17MB/s of data, reducing the throughput needed
to send this to another computer or write out to storage; a one minute
1080p camera recording is reduced from ~10GB to ~1GB. This compression
is provided by dedicated hardware acceleration (NvEnc) separate from
other hardware engines such as the GPU.

A common use case for image compression during the development of robots
is to capture camera images to storage. This captured data is processed
offline from the robot to produce training datasets for AI models, test
datasets for perception functions, and test data for open-loop
re-simulation of software in development with real data. The compression
parameters are tuned to minimize visual quality reduction from lossy
compression for AI model and perception function development.
Compression reduces the amount of data written to storage, the time
required to offload the recording, and footprint of the data at rest in
a data lake.

Compression can be used with event data recorders to capture camera
images to storage when an event of interest occurs, often due to
failures on the robot. This provides visual information to assist in the
debugging of the event or to improve perception and robot functions.

`H.264 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding>`__ is an
efficient and popular compression algorithm with broad support across
many platforms. The output of the ``isaac_ros_h264_encoder`` package on
Jetson can then be decoded with hardware acceleration using the
``isaac_ros_h264_decoder`` on Jetson and x86_64 systems, or by
third-party H.264 decoder packages on non-NVIDIA platforms.
