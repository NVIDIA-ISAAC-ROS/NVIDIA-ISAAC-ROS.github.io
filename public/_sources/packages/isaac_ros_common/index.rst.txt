The `Isaac ROS Common <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common>`__ repository contains a number of scripts and Dockerfiles to help streamline development and testing with the Isaac ROS suite.

.. container::

The Docker images included in this package provide pre-compiled binaries for ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 20.04 Focal.

Additionally, on x86_64 platforms, Docker containers allow you to quickly set up a sensitive set of frameworks and dependencies to ensure a smooth experience with Isaac ROS packages. The Dockerfiles for this platform are based on the version 22.03 image from `Deep Learning Frameworks Containers <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html>`__. On Jetson platforms, JetPack manages all of these dependencies for you.

Use of Docker images enables CI|CD systems to scale with DevOps work and run automated testing in cloud native platforms on Kubernetes.
