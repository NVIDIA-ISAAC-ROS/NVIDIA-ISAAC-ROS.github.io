Quickstart
----------

Follow the steps below to run a sample benchmark for measuring
performance of an Isaac ROS AprilTag node with ``ros2_benchmark``. This
process can also be used to benchmark the other Isaac ROS nodes, and the
``ros2_benchmark`` framework more generally supports benchmarking
arbitrary graphs of ROS 2 nodes.

1. Set up your development environment by following the instructions
   `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common/blob/main/docs/dev-env-setup.md>`__.

2. Clone this repository and its its dependencies under
   ``~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src``.

   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src &&
        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/ros2_benchmark && \
        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_benchmark && \
        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common && \
        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nitros && \
        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_image_pipeline && \
        git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_apriltag

3. Pull down ``r2b Dataset 2023`` by following the instructions
   `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/ros2_benchmark/blob/main/README.md#datasets>`__
   or fetch just the rosbag used in this Quickstart with the following
   command.

   .. code:: bash

      mkdir -p ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/ros2_benchmark/assets/datasets/r2b_dataset/r2b_storage && \
        cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/ros2_benchmark/assets/datasets/r2b_dataset/r2b_storage && \
        wget --content-disposition 'https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/resources/nvidia/isaac/r2bdataset2023/versions/1/files/r2b_storage/metadata.yaml' && \
        wget --content-disposition 'https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/resources/nvidia/isaac/r2bdataset2023/versions/1/files/r2b_storage/r2b_storage_0.db3'

4. Launch the Docker container using the ``run_dev.sh`` script:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/src/isaac_ros_common && \
        ./scripts/run_dev.sh

5. Inside the container, build and source the workspace:

   .. code:: bash

      cd /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev && \
        colcon build --symlink-install && \
        source install/setup.bash

6. (Optional) Run tests to verify complete and correct installation:

   .. code:: bash

      colcon test --executor sequential

7. Start the Isaac ROS AprilTag benchmark:

   .. code:: bash

      launch_test src/isaac_ros_benchmark/scripts/isaac_ros_apriltag_node.py

8. Once the benchmark is finished, the final performance measurements
   are displayed in the terminal.

   Additionally, the final results and benchmark metadata (e.g., system
   information, benchmark configurations) are also exported as a JSON
   file.
