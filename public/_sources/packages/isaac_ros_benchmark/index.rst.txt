Overview
--------

This package builds upon the
`ros2_benchmark <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/ros2_benchmark>`__
to provide configurations to benchmark Isaac ROS graphs. Performance
results that measure Isaac ROS for throughput, latency, and utilization
enable robotics developers to make informed decisions when designing
real-time robotics applications. The Isaac ROS performance results can
be independently verified, as the method, configuration, and data input
used for benchmarking are provided.

The ``ros2_benchmark`` playback node plug-in for type adaptation and
negotiation is provided for
`NITROS <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_nitros>`__, which
optimizes the performance of message transport costs through
`RCL <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp>`__ with GPU accelerated graphs of
nodes.

The datasets for benchmarking are explicitly not downloaded by default.
To pull down the standardized benchmark datasets, refer to the
`ros2_benchmark Dataset <https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/ros2_benchmark#datasets>`__
section.
