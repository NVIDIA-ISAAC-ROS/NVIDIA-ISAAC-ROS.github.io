Overview
--------

ROS 2 Humble introduces new hardware-acceleration features, including
type adaptation and type negotiation, that significantly increase
performance for developers seeking to incorporate AI/machine learning
and computer vision functionality into their ROS-based applications.

Type adaptation (REP-2007) is common for hardware accelerators, which
require a different data format to deliver optimal performance. Type
adaptation allows ROS nodes to work in a format better suited to the
hardware. Processing graphs can eliminate memory copies between the CPU
and the memory accelerator using the adapted type. Unnecessary memory
copies consume CPU compute, waste power, and slow down performance,
especially as the image size increases.

Type negotiation (REP-2009) allows different ROS nodes in a processing
graph to advertise their supported types so that formats yielding ideal
performance are chosen. The ROS framework performs this negotiation
process and maintains compatibility with legacy nodes that donâ€™t support
negotiation.

Accelerating processing graphs using type adaptation and negotiation
makes the hardware accelerator zero-copy possible. This reduces
software/CPU overhead and unlocks the potential of the underlying
hardware. As roboticists migrate to more powerful compute platforms like
NVIDIA Jetson Orin, they can expect to realize more of the performance
gains enabled by the hardware.

The NVIDIA implementation of type adaption and negotiation are called
NITROS (NVIDIA Isaac Transport for ROS). ROS processing graphs made up
of NITROS-based Isaac ROS hardware accelerated modules (a.k.a. GEMs or
Isaac ROS nodes) can deliver promising performance and results.
