Overview
--------

Isaac ROS AprilTag contains a ROS 2 package for detection of
`AprilTags <https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag#:~:text=AprilTag%20is%20a%20visual%20fiducial,tags%20relative%20to%20the%20camera.>`__,
a type of fiducial marker that provides a point of reference or measure.
AprilTag detections are GPU-accelerated for high performance.


A common graph of nodes connects from an input camera through rectify
and resize to AprilTag. Rectify warps the input camera image into a
rectified, undistorted output image; this node may not be necessary if
the camera driver provides rectified camera images. Resize is often used
to downscale higher resolution cameras into the desired resolution for
AprilTags if needed. The input resolution to AprilTag is selected by the
required detection distance for the application, as a minimum number of
pixels are required to perform an AprilTag detection and classification.
For example, an 8mp input image of 3840Ã—2160 may be much larger than
necessary and a 4:1 downscale to 1920x1080 could make more efficienct
use of compute resources and satisfy the required detection distance of
the application. Each of the green nodes in the above diagram is GPU
accelerated, allowing for a high-performance compute graph from Argus
Camera to ApriTag. For USB and Ethernet cameras, the graph is
accelerated from Rectify through AprilTag


As illustrated above, detections are provided in an output array for the
number of AprilTag detections in the input image. Each entry in the
array contains the ID (two-dimensional bar code) for the AprilTag, the
four corners ((x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)) and center (x, y)
of the input image, and the pose of the AprilTag.

.. note::

   This package is a GPU-accelerated drop-in replacement for
   the `CPU version of ROS
   Apriltag <https://github.com/christianrauch/apriltag_ros>`__
