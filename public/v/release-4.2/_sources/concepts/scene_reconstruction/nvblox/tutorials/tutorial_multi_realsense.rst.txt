This page contains tutorials for running :doc:`Isaac ROS Nvblox </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/index>`
together with :doc:`Isaac ROS Visual SLAM </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_visual_slam/isaac_ros_visual_slam/index>`
on multiple `Intel RealSense <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html>`__
cameras.

.. note::

   This tutorial only uses the first camera (``camera0``) for Visual SLAM due to additional camera synchronization requirements
   not required for Nvblox.

.. note::

   For a rig to mount up to 3 RealSense cameras on the Thor Developer Kit in fixed positions, see the :doc:`Thor Developer Kit RealSense Rig Assembly Guide </robots/sensor_mounting_rig/thor_devkit_realsense_rig_assembly>` where you'll also find an STL file for the rig and URDF files.

Install
-------

1. Complete the installation instructions from the :ref:`single RealSense tutorial <concepts/scene_reconstruction/nvblox/tutorials/tutorial_realsense:Install>`.


Multi-RealSense Camera Setup
----------------------------

1. Activate the Isaac ROS environment (if not started in the install step)

    .. code:: bash

        isaac-ros activate


2. For each RealSense camera, plug in one RealSense and unplug all other RealSense cameras.

    .. code:: bash

        rs-enumerate-devices

    Up top it will list the device type, Serial Number, and Firmware Version.
    Write down the Serial Number for this RealSense. Example:

    .. code:: bash

        Device info:
            Name                          : 	Intel RealSense D455
            Serial Number                 : 	151422250659
            Firmware Version              : 	5.16.0.1

3. Add a calibration URDF file to specify the transformation between ``base_link`` and each RealSense camera.
The calibration example file is stored in a default location
:ir_repo:`URDF file <isaac_ros_nvblox> <nvblox_examples/nvblox_examples_bringup/config/urdf/4_realsense_carter_example_calibration.urdf.xacro>`.
Nvblox will use it without requiring any additional arguments. Alternatively, you could create a
camera calibration URDF file, which can then be passed with ``multicam_urdf_path`` as,

    .. code:: bash

        ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup realsense_example.launch.py \
        multicam_urdf_path:=<"urdf_nominals_file_path">


RealSense Example
------------------

This example runs nvblox-based reconstruction from multiple RealSense cameras,
either from live data coming directly off RealSense cameras, or from recorded
data coming from a ROSbag.

1. Activate the Isaac ROS environment (if not started in the install step)

    .. code:: bash

        isaac-ros activate

2. Navigate (inside the Isaac ROS environment) to the workspace folder, and source the workspace

    .. code:: bash

        cd /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev
        source install/setup.bash

3. Run the RealSense example, either live from cameras or from a recorded ROSbag.

    .. tabs::

        .. tab:: Live from cameras

            1. Start cameras. Provide the serial numbers identified above as a list separated
               by comma (``camera_serial_numbers``), and the number of cameras identified as an
               integer (``num_cameras``), for example:

            .. code:: bash

                ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup realsense.launch.py \
                run_standalone:=True \
                camera_serial_numbers:='211523062311,151223061441,151422251043,215122256933' \
                container_name:='nvblox_container' \
                num_cameras:=4

            2. Switch to another terminal and start the Isaac ROS environment.
               For each camera (identified by the index of the camera ``INDEX``), ensure it publishing topics at expected
               frequency. 15Hz for color, and 60Hz for the first camera's depth (identified by
               the order of ``camera_serial_numbers`` input in the previous step), and 30Hz for other camera's
               depth. Otherwise restart the cameras in the last step until they meet the expected rates.

            .. code:: bash

                ros2 topic hz /camera${INDEX}/color/image_raw
                ros2 topic hz /camera${INDEX}/depth/image_rect_raw

            3. Switch to another terminal and start the Isaac ROS environment. Provide
               the number of cameras identified as an integer (``num_cameras``) and launch nvblox as,

            .. code:: bash

                ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup realsense_example.launch.py \
                num_cameras:=4 \
                mode:=static attach_to_container:=True \
                container_name:='nvblox_container' \
                run_realsense:=False

        .. tab:: On a ROSbag

            1. Use the rosbag ``galileo_static_3_2`` from ::ref:`nvblox quickstart <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/index:Quickstart>`
               or :ref:`record your own bag. <concepts/scene_reconstruction/nvblox/tutorials/tutorial_realsense:Recording Data With RealSense>`

            2. Provide the number of cameras identified as an integer (`num_cameras`),
               and launch nvblox thru rosbag replay:

            .. code:: bash

                ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup realsense_example.launch.py \
                num_cameras:=4 \
                mode:=static \
                attach_to_container:=False \
                run_realsense:=False \
                rosbag:=<YOUR_ROSBAG_PATH>


.. note::

   If you want to restrict odometry to a 2D plane
   (for example, to run a robot in a flat environment),
   you can use the ``enable_ground_constraint_in_odometry`` argument.


.. note::

   Based on how RealSense cameras are mounted to the platform and calibrated, users are expected to
   tune ESDF slice height specified in
   :ir_repo:`nvblox config file <isaac_ros_nvblox> <nvblox_examples/nvblox_examples_bringup/config/nvblox/specializations/nvblox_multi_realsense.yaml>`.
   Details about nvblox mapping parameters could be found at :ref:`mapper parameters <nvblox_mapper_parameters>`.

.. warning::

   The RealSense camera emitter state might be invalid and the splitter will filter the opposite images to cuVSLAM and nvblox.
   This may lead to poor tracking and reconstruction.
   See the :ref:`RealSense troubleshooting section <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/troubleshooting/troubleshooting_nvblox_realsense:Symptom: Multi-RealSense has poor tracking and reconstruction>` for more details.


Recording Data with RealSense
-----------------------------

To record RealSense data for nvblox:

1. Connect the camera, activate the Isaac ROS environment and source the
   workspace as explained in :doc:`tutorial_realsense`.

2. Start the cameras. Provide the serial numbers identified above as a list separated
   by comma (``camera_serial_numbers``), and the number of cameras identified as an
   integer (``num_cameras```), for example:

    .. code:: bash

        ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup realsense.launch.py \
        run_standalone:=True \
        camera_serial_numbers:='211523062311,151223061441,151422251043,215122256933' \
        container_name:='nvblox_container' \
        num_cameras:=4

3. Switch to another terminal and start the Isaac ROS environment.
   For each camera (identified by the index of the camera ``INDEX``), ensure it publishing topics at expected
   frequency. 15Hz for color, and 60Hz for the first camera's depth (identified by
   the order of ``camera_serial_numbers`` in the previous step), and 30Hz for other camera's
   depth. Otherwise restart the cameras in the last step until they meet the expected rates.

   .. code:: bash

       ros2 topic hz /camera${INDEX}/color/image_raw
       ros2 topic hz /camera${INDEX}/depth/image_rect_raw

4. Switch to another terminal and start the Isaac ROS environment. Provide the serial
   numbers identified above as a list separated by comma (``camera_serial_numbers``), and the number
   of cameras identified as an integer (``num_cameras```). Start recording as,

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup record_realsense.launch.py \
      num_cameras:=4 \
      camera_serial_numbers:='211523062311,151223061441,151422251043,215122256933' \
      run_rqt:=False \
      run_realsense:=False

5. Stop the recording and cameras when done.

6. The resulting ROSbag can be run using the `instructions above <#realsense-example>`_.
