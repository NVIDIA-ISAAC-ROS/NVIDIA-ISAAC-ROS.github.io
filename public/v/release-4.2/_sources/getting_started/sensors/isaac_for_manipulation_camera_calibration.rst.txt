Isaac for Manipulation Camera Calibration
==========================================


These instructions are for extrinsics calibration of a RealSense camera with a UR e-Series robot (tested with UR5e and UR10e).
For dual-camera setups, please follow the :ref:`Calibration Procedure <getting_started/sensors/isaac_for_manipulation_camera_calibration:Calibration Procedure>` twice (once for each camera),
with only one camera plugged into the system each time.

Calibration Target
------------------

Supported Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both ArUco and ChArUco calibration targets are supported with this tutorial. For best results, we recommend a ChArUco
pattern with an odd number of rows and a high number of markers, printed on the largest sized board that is suitable for the robot being calibrated.

The following ArUco pattern dictionaries are supported.

+----------------------+
| DICT_4X4_250         |
+----------------------+
| DICT_5X5_250         |
+----------------------+
| DICT_6X6_250         |
+----------------------+
| DICT_7X7_250         |
+----------------------+
| DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL  |
+----------------------+


Target Printing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calibration targets must be rigid without any noticeable bending when flat and during operation.
We recommend using aluminum/LDPE composite for the required flatness and stiffness.

.. note::

    We recommend using `calib.io <https://calib.io/>`__ to obtain high quality calibration targets. The targets used in this tutorial
    were purchased from calib.io.

If printing from a different source, ensure that the printed targets are:

    *   Non-glossy to minimize light reflections and glare.
    *   Black and white in color.

The calibration targets used in this tutorial are from `calib.io <https://calib.io/>`__ and shown below: left - UR5e target, right - UR10e target.

The specifications for the calibration targets used in this tutorial are as follows:

========== ================ ================== ===================
Robot type Board dimension  ChArUco resolution ArUco dictionary

UR5e       200x300 (mm)     14x9               DICT_5X5_250
UR10e      300x400 (mm)     12x9               DICT_5X5_250
========== ================ ================== ===================

Physical Setup
--------------

The calibration board should be mounted firmly to the end of the manipulator arm such that the board
does not shift its position when the arm is moved. Any relative movement between the board and arm during
calibration will result in inaccurate results. We recommend using a mount such as the one shown
`here <https://calib.io/products/robot-flange-mount>`__.

A calibration target attached to a UR10e robot using the mount is shown below.

.. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/calibration_target_mount_rear.jpg>`
        :width: 79%


.. note::

   The calibration board can also be held by the robot using a gripper. If using this method to hold the target and a portion of the
   ChAuCo pattern is obstructed, ensure that the calibration tool is able to successfully detect the target. Refer to **Step 11** of
   :ref:`Calibration Procedure <getting_started/sensors/isaac_for_manipulation_camera_calibration:Calibration Procedure>` for instructions
   on how to visualize the detection of the calibration target.

Calibration Procedure
---------------------

.. note::

    Before proceeding, complete the steps in :ref:`Software Setup <getting_started/sensors/isaac_for_manipulation_camera_calibration:Software Setup>`.

#.  Open a new terminal window and activate the Isaac ROS environment.

    .. code:: bash

        isaac-ros activate


    .. note::

        We recommend setting a ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` via ``export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<ID_NUMBER>`` for every
        new terminal you run ROS commands to avoid interference
        with other computers in the same network (`ROS Guide <https://docs.ros.org/en/:ir_ros_distro:/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Domain-ID.html>`__).



#.  Inside the container, source the workspace.

    .. code:: bash

        cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS} && \
        source install/setup.bash



#.  Launch the UR robot driver:

    .. code:: bash

        ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=<ROBOT_TYPE> robot_ip:=<ROBOT_IP_ADDRESS> launch_rviz:=false

    The supported robot types are: [``ur3e``, ``ur5e``, ``ur10e``, ``ur16e``]



#.  Open a second terminal window and activate the Isaac ROS environment.

    .. code:: bash

        isaac-ros activate



#.  Inside the container, source the workspace and launch the camera feed.

    .. code:: bash

        source install/setup.bash
        ros2 launch isaac_manipulator_bringup camera_calibration.launch.py camera_type:=REALSENSE

    This launch file launches the camera pipeline for RealSense. After launch you can verify that camera topics are publishing data, for example, ``/camera_1/color/image_raw``.



#.  Open a third terminal window and activate the Isaac ROS environment.

    .. code:: bash

        isaac-ros activate

    .. note::

     If the RViz window with the **HandEyeCalibration** crashes, restart the window by rerunning the commands below.


#.  Inside the container, source the workspace and launch the robot with RViz.

    .. code:: bash

        source install/setup.bash
        ros2 launch isaac_ros_cumotion_examples ur.launch.py ur_type:=<ROBOT_TYPE> robot_ip:=<ROBOT_IP_ADDRESS> launch_rviz:=true

    The supported robot types are: [``ur3e``, ``ur5e``, ``ur10e``, ``ur16e``]


#. Close the ``MotionPlanning`` panel on the left side of the window. This must be done to allow for image panels to be added to RViz in a later step. **If this step is not done, the application can crash**.


#.  In the RViz window that opens, click on **Add** > **By display type** > **moveit_calibration_gui** > **HandEyeCalibration**.
    Click on **OK** to add the calibration panel to the window. Verify that you have a new panel added to the left side of the RViz
    window titled **HandEye Calibration**.

    .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/hawk_add.png>`
        :width: 59%


#.  In the **HandEye Calibration** panel, click on the **Target** tab and set the following parameters:

    ======================== ================================================================
    Target Type              HandEyeTarget/Charuco
    squares, X               *Number of squares in calibration target along X direction*
    squares, Y               *Number of squares in calibration target along Y direction*
    marker size (px)         1500
    square size (px)         2400
    margin size (px)         60
    marker border (bits)     *Number of bits around marker border*
    ArUco dictionary         DICT_5X5_250
    longest board side (m)   *Measured length of longest side of the board pattern in meters*
    measured marker size (m) *Measured length of marker in meters*
    ======================== ================================================================

    The following values may be used directly if using the `calib.io <https://calib.io/>`__ calibration targets that were recommended in the
    :ref:`Calibration Target <getting_started/sensors/isaac_for_manipulation_camera_calibration:Calibration Target>` section above.

    ======================== ================================================================
    Target Type              ``HandEyeTarget/Charuco``
    squares, X               ``12`` (for UR10e target), ``14`` (for UR5e target)
    squares, Y               ``9``
    marker size (px)         ``1500``
    square size (px)         ``2400``
    margin size (px)         ``60``
    marker border (bits)     ``1``
    ArUco dictionary         ``DICT_5X5_250``
    longest board side (m)   ``0.36`` (for UR10e target), ``0.28`` (for UR5e target)
    measured marker size (m) ``0.022`` (for UR10e target), ``0.015`` (for UR5e target)
    ======================== ================================================================

    After the above values have been set, click on **Create Target**.

    Lastly, click on the **Camera Image Topic** drop down menu and select the appropriate image topic.
    For RealSense the topic is ``/camera_1/color/image_raw``.

    .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/hawk_target_small.png>`
        :width: 79%

#.  In the **HandEye Calibration** panel, click on the **Context** tab and set the following parameters.

    ======================== ====================================================
    Sensor Configuration     Eye-to-hand
    Sensor frame             ``camera_1_link``
    Object frame             ``handeye_target``
    End-effector frame       ``wrist_3_link``
    Robot base frame         ``world``
    ======================== ====================================================

    .. note::

        After setting the ``Sensor frame``, the UI may freeze for a few seconds before becoming responsive again.

    .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/hawk_context_small.png>`
        :width: 59%



#.  Add a panel to visualize the calibration target detection by clicking
    **Add** > **By topic** > **/handeye_calibration** > **/target_detection** > **Image**. Click on **OK** to add.

    .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/calibration_target_vis_rviz_add.png>`
        :width: 59%

    Verify that you have a new panel added to the left side of the RViz
    window titled **Image** which shows the detected pose of the calibration target.

    .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/calibration_target_detection.png>`
        :width: 79%



#.  Add TF visualizations for the camera and target. In the RViz window, click on **Add** > **By display type** > **rviz_default_plugins** > **TF**.
    Click on **OK** to add the visualization to the window.
    Verify that you have an entry titled **TF** in the **Displays** panel on the left side of the window. Expand
    the **TF** entry and then click on **Frames** and deselect the option titled **All Enabled**. Scroll through the
    list of frames and re-enable ``camera_1_link`` and ``handeye_target``. These are the camera frame and target frame, respectively.



#.  In the **HandEye Calibration** panel, click on the **Context** tab and use the sliders under **Camera Pose Initial Guess**
    to provide an initial pose estimation. Adjust the translation and rotation values until the TF visualizations on the
    right side of the window roughly correspond with the position of the camera and target board in real life with respect
    to the manipulator arm.



#.  In the **HandEye Calibration** panel, click on the **Calibrate** tab. Make sure the calibration board is visible in the camera
    image. Move the manipulator arm to a desired pose and click **Take sample**. If the sample is successfully taken, it will
    it appear in the box titled **Pose samples**. After a minimum of 5 samples are taken, the tool will compute a camera pose
    together with a corresponding reprojection error (it appears at the bottom-left of the **HandEyeCalibration** window). Continue to move the manipulator arm and collect samples until the desired number
    of samples is achieved.

    .. note::

        * Adding more diverse samples will typically lead to a more robust calibration. It is recommended that a minimum of **2** translational poses are used with approximately **10** rotations for each translation.
            The rotations should be made by moving the board along all three axes (roll, pitch, yaw) at the same time to ensure each rotation
            is sufficiently different from the prior. Additional rotations can be added to improve the accuracy of the calibration.
            The translational poses should be positioned within the workspace of the manipulator arm.


        * Verify that reprojection error is low enough for your application, and that the camera
            position in RViz looks reasonable and aligns with the simulated robot.
            The procedure described in these instructions have been tested to provide reprojection error
            under 0.002 m and 0.002 rad.

    After the desired number of samples are taken, save the calibration results by clicking **Save camera pose**.

    .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/manipulator_camera_calibration/hawk_calibrate_small.png>`
        :width: 79%

    .. note::

        Different solvers yield different calibration results, we recommend experimenting with different solvers to see which yields the
        best results for your use case. To select a different solver, click on the drop down menu next to **AX=XB Solver** and click
        on the desired solver. Then click on the **Solve** button to recompute the calibration results with the selected solver.

    The ``calibration.launch.py`` output from the calibration tool will include a code snippet similar to the following example (values included for illustration only as they will differ for different setups):

#. First we record a calibration dataset that stores RGB and infrared camera streams, TFs
   (to store extrinsic calibration from robot to the camera, and inter-camera transforms between RGB and infrared streams)
   and camera information (to record camera intrinsics).

#. Then we perform a test that visualizes errors in the following

     - Target pose estimation using OpenCV's Perspective in Pose solver.
     - The factory calibrated intrinsic transforms between RGB and infrared streams.
     - Using 2 extrinsic calibrations to get error bounds of the calibration process.


#. Before running the calibration data recording script, make sure to have the following:
   - The calibration target seen by the camera and is static.
   - The target should be placed such that it takes over as much of the image / field of view as possible.

#. Run this command that will record the data (this will take 60 seconds) and then will run the test.

#. Perhaps the most important thing is to look at the images and observe how the error increases once you add more computations in the pose estimation process from OpenCV's solver, to using intrinsics and then to using 2 extrinsic calibrations.

#. As an example, this is what the OpenCV pose error visualized looks like. Here, you just see red dots, since the blue dots that are projected match the pixel value exactly.

#. This is what the error looks like once you add the intrinsics calibration. You start to see a small error.

#. This is what the error looks like once you add the 2 extrinsic calibrations. You start to see a bigger error that can be around 1 cm at the worst case scenario. You will notice that the error is around half the size of the corner squares and each corner is 2 cm which puts our camera to target distance at around 1.5 cm. This number is inflated as the error in the 2 calibration compounds on each other, so the actual error might be closer to 5 mm.

#. Careful calibrations with a wide coverage can help drive down this error.

#. This also motivates the need for data driven robotics algorithms that are robust to such errors in calibration.
