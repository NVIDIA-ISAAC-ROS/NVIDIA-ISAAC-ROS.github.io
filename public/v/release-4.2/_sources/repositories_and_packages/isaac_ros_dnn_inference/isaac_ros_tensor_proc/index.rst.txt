API

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The ``isaac_ros_tensor_proc`` package offers functionality for processing tensors, such as normalizing tensors, converting images to tensors,
reshaping tensors and more. The main use case of this package is for preprocessing or postprocessing tensors following DNN model inference.
One major use case of this package can be found in :doc:`Isaac ROS DNN Image Encoder </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_dnn_inference/isaac_ros_dnn_image_encoder/index>`.
The operations performed aim to be analogous to operations available in the PyTorch library.
