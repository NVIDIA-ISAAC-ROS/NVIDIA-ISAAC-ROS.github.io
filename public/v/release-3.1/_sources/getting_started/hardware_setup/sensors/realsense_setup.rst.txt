.. note::

  It is required to use RealSense firmware `version 5.13.0.50 <https://dev.realsenseai.com/docs/firmware-releases-d400>`__, `librealsense` `version 2.55.1 <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.55.1>`__ and RealSense camera ROS driver `version 4.51.1 <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/tree/4.51.1>`__.
  **Any deviation from these versions will break Isaac ROS examples.**

.. note::

    For best results we suggest increasing the maximum Linux kernel receive buffer size as
    detailed `here <https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/DDS-tuning.html#cyclone-dds-tuning>`__.

Setup Instructions
------------------

.. note::

  This tutorial assumes that you have completed the instructions in :doc:`Developer Environment Setup </getting_started/dev_env_setup>`.

1. Clone the ``realsense-ros`` repository:

  .. note::

    ``${ISAAC_ROS_WS}`` is defined to point to ``/ssd/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/`` or ``~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/``.

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src
    git clone :ir_clone:`<isaac_ros_common>`
    git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros.git -b 4.51.1

  .. note::

    Plug in your RealSense camera before launching the Docker container in the next step.

2. Configure the container created by ``isaac_ros_common/scripts/run_dev.sh`` to include ``librealsense`` and ``realsense2-camera``. Create the ``.isaac_ros_common-config`` file in the ``isaac_ros_common/scripts`` directory:

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common/scripts && \
    touch .isaac_ros_common-config && \
    echo CONFIG_IMAGE_KEY=ros2_humble.realsense > .isaac_ros_common-config

3. Launch the Docker container:

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common && \
    ./scripts/run_dev.sh -d ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}

  This rebuilds the container image using ``Dockerfile.realsense`` in one of its layered stage. Rebuilding can take several minutes.

4. Build the ``realsense_splitter`` and ``realsense2*`` packages:

   .. code:: bash

       cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS} && \
       colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to-regex realsense*

5. After the container image is rebuilt and you are inside the container, you can run ``realsense-viewer`` to verify that the RealSense camera is connected.

  .. code:: bash

    realsense-viewer

  If you turn on the "Stereo Module" in the GUI, you should see something like the following:
