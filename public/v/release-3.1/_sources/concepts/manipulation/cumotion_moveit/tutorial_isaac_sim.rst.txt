Overview
------------

This tutorial walks through the process of planning trajectories for a simulated Franka robot
in Isaac Sim leveraging the cuMotion plugin for MoveIt 2 provided by
:ir_repo:`Isaac ROS cuMotion <isaac_ros_cumotion>`.  It is based on an
`example <https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/how_to_guides/isaac_panda/isaac_panda_tutorial.html>`_
developed by PickNik Robotics, which in turn was based on a less featureful MoveIt example provided
with Isaac Sim.

This tutorial has been tested with Isaac Sim 4.0 and Isaac Sim 2023.1.1.

Tutorial Walkthrough
--------------------

1. Set up your development environment by following the instructions in :doc:`Getting Started </getting_started/dev_env_setup>`.

2. Clone ``isaac_ros_common`` under ``${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src``.

   .. code:: bash

      cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src && \
         git clone :ir_clone:`<isaac_ros_common>`

3. Install the ``isaac_ros_cumotion_examples`` package and its dependencies
   (including ``isaac_ros_cumotion`` and ``isaac_ros_cumotion_moveit``):

   .. include:: /repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_cumotion/isaac_ros_cumotion_moveit/_snippets/install.rst

4. Install and configure Isaac Sim following the steps in the
   :doc:`Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide </getting_started/isaac_sim/index>`, stopping after step 4.

5. This tutorial uses the Isaac Sim "standalone workflow," in which Isaac Sim is launched via a python script.  In the
   terminal opened using the **"Open in Terminal"** button in the Isaac Sim App Selector (and notably **not** in a shell
   within the Isaac ROS docker container), source your ROS 2 workspace, e.g.,

   .. code:: bash

      source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

6. Run ``python.sh`` with the full path to the ``start_isaac_sim_franka.py`` script provided by the
   ``isaac_ros_cumotion_examples`` package.  Please note that this is a standalone script and could be copied to
   another location for convenience.

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Binary Package

         Please clone or download the script from :ir_repo:`here <isaac_ros_cumotion> <isaac_ros_cumotion_examples/isaac_sim_scripts/start_isaac_sim_franka.py>`.  Then run it with ``python.sh`` as follows.

         .. code:: bash

            ./python.sh <DOWNLOAD_PATH>/start_isaac_sim_franka.py

      .. tab:: Build from Source

         .. code:: bash

            ./python.sh ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_cumotion/isaac_ros_cumotion_examples/isaac_sim_scripts/start_isaac_sim_franka.py

   Once Isaac Sim fully loads, the timeline will begin playing automatically.

   .. note::

      The example should be loaded in Isaac Sim before MoveIt is launched.

7. In a terminal within the Isaac ROS Docker container, launch MoveIt (including RViz) using the provided
   launch file.  Remember to first run ``source install/setup.bash`` if package was built from source.

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 launch isaac_ros_cumotion_examples franka_isaac_sim.launch.py

   The visualization of the robot in RViz should reflect the current joint state of the
   simulated robot in Isaac Sim.

7. In a separate terminal within the Docker container, run the cuMotion planner node.  Remember to first run
   ``source install/setup.bash`` if package was built from source.

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 run isaac_ros_cumotion cumotion_planner_node --ros-args -p robot:=franka.xrdf -p urdf_path:=/opt/ros/humble/share/moveit_resources_panda_description/urdf/panda.urdf

8. In RViz, enable cuMotion by ensuring that ``isaac_ros_cumotion`` and ``cuMotion`` are selected within the
   **"Planning Library"** pane within the **"Context"** tab in the bottom left corner of the RViz window.

9. Then select a target pose for the robot end effector, and click the **"Plan"** button in the **"Planning"** tab.
   If planning is successful, an animation of the trajectory will be visualized in RViz.
10. Click the **"Execute"** button in RViz.  The simulated Franka robot in Isaac Sim will follow the motion of
    the robot in RViz.
