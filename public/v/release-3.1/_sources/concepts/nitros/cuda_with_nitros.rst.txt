CUDA with NITROS
================


Overview
--------

CUDA is a parallel computing programming model and helps robotic applications to implement functions
that would otherwise be too slow on a CPU.

CUDA implemented in a ROS 2 node can take advantage of NITROS, the Isaac ROS implementation of type
adaptation & type negotiation which enables accelerated computing in ROS 2.

By using the NITROS publisher, CUDA code in a ROS node can share its output in GPU accelerated memory
to NITROS enabled Isaac ROS nodes. This improves performance by avoiding CPU memory copies, and increasing
the parallel compute between the GPU compute and CPU processing. NITROS maintains compatibility with
other ROS nodes subscribing to the topic such as RViz.

By using the NITROS subscriber, CUDA code in a ROS node can receive its input in GPU accelerated memory
from a NITROS enabled Isaac ROS node, or another CUDA enabled ROS node publishing by using a NITROS subscriber.
This has the same benefits of reducing CPU memory copies and increasing parallel computing between the GPU
and CPU.

NITROS publisher and NITROS subscriber enable many design patterns compatible with Isaac ROS accelerate
computing nodes, and traditional CPU nodes.  For example publishing from a CUDA node directly to an Isaac ROS
node, or visa-versa from an Isaac ROS node to a CUDA node. A CUDA node can be inserted between two Isaac ROS
nodes, or even use multiple CUDA nodes in succession, all with the benefit of CUDA accelerated computing in each
node. This creates more modular software designs, as CUDA accelerated functions can be packaged in individual
nodes, instead of packing them together into a larger single node.

Core Concepts
-------------

Managed NITROS Publisher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Managed NITROS Publisher provides a familiar interface
for publishing messages into NITROS-enabled graphs. The API is
comparable to the standard ``rclcpp::Publisher`` API, making it easy to
add a Managed NITROS Publisher to an existing ROS 2 node.

Managed NITROS Publishers are specifically designed to publish
NITROS-typed messages. These NITROS types are listed under the
``isaac_ros_nitros_types`` subfolder.

.. note::

   Currently, the Managed NITROS Publisher is only compatible
   with the ``isaac_ros_nitros_tensor_list_type``  and ``isaac_ros_nitros_image_type``. 
   These types enable you to send and receive tensors and images to and from packages in Isaac ROS DNN
   Inference.

Managed NITROS Subscriber
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Managed NITROS Subscriber is analogous to the Managed NITROS
Publisher, offering a straightforward, ``rclcpp::Subscriber``-like
interface for subscribing to messages from NITROS-enabled graphs.

Managed NITROS Subscribers are specifically designed to receive
NITROS-typed messages. These NITROS types are listed under the
``isaac_ros_nitros_types`` subfolder.

.. note::

   Currently, the Managed NITROS Subscriber is only compatible
   with the ``isaac_ros_nitros_tensor_list_type`` and ``isaac_ros_nitros_image_type``.

NITROS Builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NITROS Builders are a series of utility classes that streamline the
process of creating a NITROS-typed message. These classes offer a
builder-style interface, allowing developers to specify relevant fields
for object construction one at a time:

.. code:: cpp

   using namespace nvidia::isaac_ros::nitros;
   NitrosTensorList tensor_list = NitrosTensorListBuilder()
       .WithHeader(ros_header)
       .AddTensor("tensor_1", foo_tensor)
       .AddTensor("tensor_2", bar_tensor)
       .Build();

The collection of NITROS Builders also includes additional builders that
construct individual components of the broader NITROS types. For
example, a ``NitrosTensorBuilder`` can be used to produce a
``NitrosTensor`` that is subsequently consumed by a
``NitrosTensorListBuilder``.

NITROS Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~

NITROS Views are a series of utility classes that simplify the process
of accessing fields of a NITROS-typed message. These classes offer an
analogous interface to the NITROS Builder, allowing developers to
retrieve specific portions of a composite structure and process them
accordingly.

Managed NITROS Message Filter Subscriber
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Managed NITROS Message Filter Subscriber is analogous to the `Message Filter Subscriber <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/p/message_filters/>`__ ,
offering a ``message_filters::Subscriber``-like
interface for subscribing to messages from NITROS-enabled graphs. This subscriber can be passed to a
``message_filters::Synchronizer`` to synchronize messages from NITROS and non-NITROS topics.

The Managed NITROS Message Filter Subscriber is implemented as a template to work with the NITROS Views mentioned above.

Please refer to the `Message Filter Subscriber <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/p/message_filters/>`__ for more details. You can also find an example in the ``NitrosCameraDropNode`` 
:ir_repo:`isaac_ros_nitros_topic_tools/isaac_ros_nitros_camera_drop_node <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_nitros_topic_tools/src/isaac_ros_nitros_camera_drop_node.cpp>`

Standard Usage
--------------

The standard pattern for using Managed NITROS involves 3 key steps:

1. Encoding arbitrary data into an appropriate NITROS-type message using
   a Custom NITROS encoder node
2. Processing the NITROS-type message using NITROS-enabled ROS 2 nodes
3. Decoding an output NITROS-type message into an arbitrary format using
   a Custom NITROS decoder node

For example, a graph for performing DNN-based segmentation on pointclouds might involve:

1. A Custom NITROS encoder node that converts a ``sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`` into a ``NitrosTensorList``
2. The Isaac ROS TensorRT node that performs DNN inference on the TensorRT backend, taking in an input ``NitrosTensorList`` and producing an output ``NitrosTensorList``
3. A Custom NITROS decoder node that converts the output ``NitrosTensorList`` into a segmented ``sensor_msgs/PointCloud2``

Examples
--------

Custom NITROS String Encoder and Decoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ir_repo:`isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string/package.xml>`
package contains a minimal example that demonstrates how a pair of
Custom NITROS encoder and decoder nodes can leverage Managed NITROS
utilities.

The included :ir_repo:`launch test <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string/test/custom_nitros_string_pol.py>`
uses a minimal graph of just two nodes:

1. :ir_repo:`StringEncoderNode <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string/include/custom_nitros_string/string_encoder_node.hpp>`
   that encodes a ``std_msgs/String`` message into a ``NitrosTensorList``
2. :ir_repo:`StringDecoderNode <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string/include/custom_nitros_string/string_decoder_node.hpp>`
   that decodes a ``NitrosTensorList`` back into a ``std_msgs/String``

.. note::
   Since there is no NITROS type designed specifically for
   strings, this examples uses the ``NitrosTensorList`` type to encode
   string data. The flexibility of the ``NitrosTensorList`` format
   supports the encoding of arbitrary data.

The :ir_repo:`StringEncoderNode's implementation <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string/src/string_encoder_node.cpp>`
demonstrates usage of the NITROS Builder utilities. The
``StringEncoderNode::InputCallback`` function begins by allocating a
CUDA buffer to store the received ``std_msgs/String``'s data. In this
minimal example, the character bytes are copied over to the CUDA buffer
without any need for additional encoding. Then, a
``NitrosTensorBuilder`` is used to build a ``NitrosTensor``, which is
then added to a ``NitrosTensorListBuilder`` with the
name ``"input_tensor"``. Finally, the ``NitrosTensorListBuilder::Build``
method produces the output ``NitrosTensorList`` that is published via
the ``StringEncoderNode``'s Managed NITROS publisher.

The :ir_repo:`StringDecoderNode's implementation <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_string/src/string_decoder_node.cpp>`
demonstrates usage of the NITROS View utilities. The
``StringDecoderNode::InputCallback`` function begins by resizing a
``std::string`` buffer to store the data that will eventually be
extracted from the ``NitrosTensorList``. The Managed NITROS Subscriber
receives a ``NitrosTensorListView``, through which it extracts the
``NitrosTensorView`` corresponding to ``"input_tensor"`` using the
``NitrosTensorListView::GetNamedTensor`` method. Since the data in
``NitrosTensorView``'s CUDA buffer was originally encoded in a trivial
way, the decoding is similarly straightforward: the character bytes are
copied over without any need for additional decoding. Finally, the
``std::string`` is copied to a ``std_msgs/String`` message and published
with a standard publisher.

Custom NITROS Image Builder and Viewer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ir_repo:`isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image/package.xml>`
package contains an intermediate example of Managed NITROS functionality
for passing images.

The included :ir_repo:`launch test <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image/test/custom_nitros_image_pol.py>`
uses a minimal graph of just two nodes:

1. :ir_repo:`GpuImageBuilderNode <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image/include/custom_nitros_image/gpu_image_builder_node.hpp>`
that encodes a ``sensor_msgs/Image`` message into a ``NitrosImage``
2. :ir_repo:`GpuImageViewerNode <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image/include/custom_nitros_image/gpu_image_viewer_node.hpp>`
that decodes a ``NitrosImage`` back into a ``sensor_msgs/Image``

The :ir_repo:`GpuImageBuilderNode's implementation <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image/src/gpu_image_builder_node.cpp>`
demonstrates usage of the NITROS Builder utilities. The
``GpuImageBuilderNode::InputCallback`` function begins by allocating a
CUDA buffer to store the received ``sensor_msgs/Image``'s data. In
this minimal example, the bytes are copied over to the CUDA buffer
without any interleaving or other processing. Then, a
``NitrosImageBuilder`` is used to build a ``NitrosImage`` from the ROS
header, appropriate ``sensor_msgs``-standard image encoding, image
dimensions, and CUDA buffer from the previous step. The
``NitrosImageBuilder::Build`` method produces the output ``NitrosImage``
that is published via the ``GpuImageBuilderNode``'s Managed NITROS
publisher.

The :ir_repo:`GpuImageViewerNode's implementation <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_image/src/gpu_image_viewer_node.cpp>`
demonstrates usage of the NITROS View utilities. The
``GpuImageViewerNode::InputCallback`` function begins by creating a
``sensor_msgs/Image`` message and populating its basic fields through
the ``NitrosImageView`` object's straightforward getters. Next, the
output image's data vector is resized to ensure it will appropriately
fit the actual image data. Finally, the image's data bytes are copied
over without any additional processing, and the output message is
published with a standard publisher.

Custom NITROS DNN Image Encoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ir_repo:`isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_dnn_image_encoder <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_dnn_image_encoder/package.xml>`
package contains an advanced example of Managed NITROS functionality
for encoding images as tensors for DNN inference.

As shown in the included :ir_repo:`launch file <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_managed_nitros_examples/custom_nitros_dnn_image_encoder/launch/custom_image_isaac_ros_dope_tensor_rt.launch.py>`,
this package's ``ImageEncoderNode`` has identical functionality to the standard :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS DNN Image Encoder Node <isaac_ros_dnn_inference> <isaac_ros_dnn_image_encoder/src/dnn_image_encoder_node.cpp>`.

This example leverages NVIDIA's `CV-CUDA library <https://developer.nvidia.com/cv-cuda>`__ to perform the core image normalization operations.
CUDA with NITROS unlocks the full value of libraries like CV-CUDA for high performance robotics applications.

Managed NITROS Message Filter Synchronization 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ir_repo:`isaac_ros_nitros_topic_tools/isaac_ros_nitros_camera_drop_node <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_nitros_topic_tools/package.xml>`
package contains an example of synchronize NITROS and non-NITROS topics using Managed NITROS Message Filter Subscriber.

As shown in the included :ir_repo:`launch file <isaac_ros_nitros> <isaac_ros_nitros_topic_tools/launch/isaac_ros_nitros_camera_drop.launch.py>`,
this package's ``NitrosCameraDropNode`` has similar functionality to the standard `DropNode <https://github.com/ros-tooling/topic_tools/blob/rolling/topic_tools/src/drop_node.cpp>`__, but
uses the Managed NITROS Message Filter Subscriber to synchronize messages from NITROS and non-NITROS topics.
