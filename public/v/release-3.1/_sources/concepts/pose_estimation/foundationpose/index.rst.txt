FoundationPose
==============

The `FoundationPose <https://github.com/NVlabs/FoundationPose>`__ 
model is a pre-trained deep learning model developed by NVLabs. It estimates 
the 6DoF pose of an 3D object using the object's image, depth map, detection bounding box
and 3D CAD model without any need to retrain for different and novel objects. 
The output from the network is the estimated vector containing the pose and tracking information
of the object. 

Compared to other pose estimation models, the FoundationPose model provides significant improvement
on zero-shot objects,  without need to further fine tune the network. While FoundationPose pose estimation
is compute intensive, inference can be run at a lower frequency. This can be complemented with
FoundationPose tracking, which runs at over 120 FPS on Jetson Orin.
