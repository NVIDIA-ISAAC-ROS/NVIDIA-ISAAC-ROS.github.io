Tutorial: Calibrating the Sensors
=================================

This tutorial will enable you to calibrate the sensors on Nova Carter using the
Nova Calibration Tool.

The Nova Calibration Tool is a containerized application that guides you
through the process of calibrating the poses of the sensors on a Nova Carter
robot.  

Instructions
------------

1. SSH into the robot (:ref:`instructions<nova-carter-ssh-setup>`).

2. Follow the instructions to  
   :ir_ngc:`set up calibration <teams/isaac/containers/nova_extrinsics_sensor_calibration_tool>`.

3. If the calibration is successful, you should see a URDF file generated at
   ``/etc/nova/calibration/isaac_calibration.urdf``. 

   This is also the default URDF path used by the demo applications in the other Nova Carter tutorials.

.. note:: 
    
    You also have access to a URDF file with nominal values located at
    ``/etc/nova/calibration/isaac_nominals.urdf``. This file is useful as
    a backup in case calibration fails, but in general, always use
    ``isaac_calibration.urdf`` because it better reflects the true extrinsics of
    your physical robot.
