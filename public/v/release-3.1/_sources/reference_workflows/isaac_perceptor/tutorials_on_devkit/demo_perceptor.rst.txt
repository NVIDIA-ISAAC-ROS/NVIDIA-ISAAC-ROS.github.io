Tutorial: Running Camera-based 3D Perception with `Isaac Perceptor`
===================================================================

This tutorial walks you through using `Isaac Perceptor` on the `Nova Orin Developer Kit`.
`Isaac Perceptor` uses Isaac ROS components, including Visual SLAM to localize the robot, ESS and
nvblox to reconstruct 3D environments.

For this tutorial, you must have successfully completed the
:doc:`Tutorial: running all sensors on the Nova Orin Developer Kit</reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/tutorials_on_devkit/demo_sensors>`.


Running the Application
-----------------------

1. SSH into the `Nova Orin Developer Kit` (:ref:`instructions<nova-developer-kit-ssh-setup>`).

2. Build/install the required packages and run the app:

.. run_ros_app::
    :repo_setup: <nova-developer-kit-dev-setup>
    :repo: nova_developer_kit
    :image: isaac/nova_developer_kit_bringup:release_3.1-aarch64
    :package: nova_developer_kit_bringup
    :app: perceptor.launch.py
    :asset_packages: isaac_ros_ess_models_install:isaac_ros_peoplesemseg_models_install:isaac_ros_peoplesemseg_models_install
    :asset_scripts: install_ess_models.sh:install_peoplesemsegnet_vanilla.sh:install_peoplesemsegnet_shuffleseg.sh

.. note::

   Please launch the application, ensure you follow :doc:`the mounting guide </reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/run_perceptor_on_devkit>`
   for correct mounting procedures, and configuration changes.

Customizing Sensor Configurations
---------------------------------

By default, as specified in the launch file ``perceptor.launch.py``, all 3 stereo
cameras available on the `Nova Orin Developer Kit` (front, left, right) are used in
`Isaac Perceptor` algorithms.
You may use the ``stereo_camera_configuration`` launch argument to customize camera
configurations when running `Isaac Perceptor`.

For example, to use only front stereo camera for 3D reconstruction and visual SLAM
you could run the following launch command:

.. code:: bash

    ros2 launch nova_developer_kit_bringup perceptor.launch.py \
        stereo_camera_configuration:=front_configuration

For example, to use only front stereo camera for 3D reconstruction, visual SLAM
and people reconstruction, you could run the following launch command:

.. code:: bash

    ros2 launch nova_developer_kit_bringup perceptor.launch.py \
        stereo_camera_configuration:=front_people_configuration

For a detailed description of all available configurations refer to
:doc:`Tutorial: Stereo Camera Configurations for Isaac Perceptor </reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/tutorials_on_devkit/tutorial_stereo_camera_configurations>`.


Visualizing the Outputs
------------------------

1. Make sure you complete :ref:`visualization-setup-devkit`.
   This is required to visualize the `Isaac nvblox` mesh in a recommended layout configuration.

2. Open the Foxglove studio on your remote machine.

   1. If you are **not** running a configuration with people reconstruction,
      open the ``nova_developer_kit_perceptor.json`` layout file downloaded in the previous step.

   2. If you are running a configuration with people reconstruction,
      open the ``nova_developer_kit_perceptor_with_people.json`` layout file
      downloaded in the previous step.

3. In Foxglove, it shows a visualization of the `Nova Orin Developer Kit` platform and
   `Isaac nvblox` mesh visualization of surrounding environments.
   You should expect a visualization similar as below.
   In the mesh, it shows the reconstructed colored voxels,
   the computed distance map from `Isaac nvblox` outputs.
   The colored voxels are uniformly reconstructed with a resolution of 5cm.
   The rainbow color spectrum reflects the proximity of each region
   to nearest obstacles. Regions closer to obstacle surfaces are marked in warmer colors
   (red, orange), while regions further away from obstacle surfaces are marked in cooler
   colors (blue, violet).

4. If running a configuration with people reconstruction, in addition,
   you can see highlighted red voxels shown in the reconstructed mesh.
   It visualizes people perceived in the field of view of one or more cameras. In the default
   ``nova_developer_kit_perceptor_with_people.json`` layout file,
   only ``/nvblox_human_node/dynamic_occupancy_layer`` is visualized and shown as the red voxels.

.. note::

   For a better visualization experience, some topics requiring a large bandwidth are not available
   to Foxglove studio. You can set ``use_foxglove_whitelist:=False`` as additional argument
   when running the app. Most likely the image stream will be fairly choppy given its large
   bandwidth. To learn more about topics published by `Isaac nvblox`, you can refer to
   :doc:`nvblox ROS messages. </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/api/topics_and_services>`.
   For topics published by `Isaac visual SLAM`, you can refer to
   :doc:`cuvslam ROS messages. </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_visual_slam/isaac_ros_visual_slam/index>`.

Evaluating `Isaac Perceptor`
----------------------------

Follow these instructions to assert that `Isaac Perceptor` is performing as
expected.

1. `Isaac nvblox` continuously measures computation efficiency metrics and reports
   them in the terminal. You should expect to see metrics similar to the following:

   1. ``nvblox Rates`` reports how the frequencies of specific events happening
      in nvblox. For the **3-camera** configuration, you are expected to see
      ``ros/depth_image_callback`` at 60Hz, and ``ros/color_image_callback``
      at 90Hz. For the **1-camera** configuration, you are expected to see
      ``ros/depth_image_callback`` at 30Hz, and ``ros/color_image_callback``
      at 30Hz.

    .. code:: bash

        nvblox Rates (in Hz)
        namespace/tag - NumSamples (Window Length) - Mean
        -----------
        ros/color                   100              13.2
        ros/depth                   100              60.4
        ros/depth_image_callback    100              60.8
        ros/color_image_callback    100              90.8
        ros/update_esdf             100              7.2
        mapper/stream_mesh          100              4.5
        ros/tick                    100              16.7
        -----------

   2. ``nvblox Delays`` reports the average compute time a node takes in second
      based on a certain number of samples. You are expected to see
      ``ros/esdf_integration`` at 100 ~ 200 ms.

    .. code:: bash

        nvblox Delays
        namespace/tag - NumSamples (Window Length) - Mean Delay (seconds)
        -----------
        ros/esdf_integration        100              0.174
        ros/depth_image_integration 100              0.152
        ros/color_image_integration 100              0.129
        ros/depth_image_callback    100              0.106
        ros/color_image_callback    100              0.068
        -----------

2. To further evaluate the quality of `Isaac Perceptor`, you can perform the following tests.

    1. Choose objects above 10cm with various heights, and place them in front of
       any camera specified in the ``stereo_camera_configuration`` launch argument.
       Vary the distance to the camera (e.g. 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m). You should expect to see the
       object in the distance map visualization.
       Additionally, you may also use the `Measure Tool` in the top panel to measure
       the distance between the object surface and the camera center.

       For instance, a pallet at the height of 10cm and a box at the height of 50cm are placed
       in front of the front stereo camera. We vary its distance to the robot
       at 0.4m, 1.0m, 3.0m, 5.0m. In the 3D view, you could see colored voxels visualizing
       the pallet and the box (illustrated by bounding boxes in green and blue). The proximity value
       measured by `Measure Tool` shows the distance between the front camera and perceived objects.
       You are expected to obtain similar proximity value with the distance you place objects at.

       You are advised to follow :doc:`Technical Details </concepts/scene_reconstruction/nvblox/technical_details>`
       to understand how scene reconstruction works.

       .. note::
         Objects detection range shown in the reconstructed 3D mesh is sensitive to the
         sensor calibration accuracy.
         Ensure you follow :doc:`the mounting guide </reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/run_perceptor_on_devkit>`
         for correct mounting procedures, and configuration changes.

    2. Ensure `Nova Orin Developer Kit` is stationary. You are expected to see no drift
       from the `Nova Orin Developer Kit` visualization with reference to the odometry frame.
       You are advised to follow :doc:`cuVSLAM </concepts/visual_slam/cuvslam/index>`
       to understand how visual SLAM works.
