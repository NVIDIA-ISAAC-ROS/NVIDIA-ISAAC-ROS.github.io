Isaac Sim Issues
================

This page contains troubleshooting for the Nvblox Isaac Sim examples.
When creating a custom scene there might be new issues which come up from the simulation side.
Some of the known issues and their solutions are explained in this document.

Robot jitters on ground
-----------------------

This can happen if the floor of the scene used is uneven and the physics
interaction between the floor and the robot is **on**.
The two approaches to overcome this issue are:

1. Remove physics/collisions between the floor and the robot and use a invisible ground plane instead. 
   If the physics interactions can't be removed for any reason then use option 2.
2. Insert an invisible ground plane just above the floor and shift the robot to be on this ground plane. 
   This way, the robot will interact with a flat surface instead of an uneven floor.
