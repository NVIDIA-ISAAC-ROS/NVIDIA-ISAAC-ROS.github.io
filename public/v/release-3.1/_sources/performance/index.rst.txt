Methodology
-----------

The performance numbers provided above are measured using 
:doc:`Isaac ROS Benchmark </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_benchmark/index>`. 
Configuration files for reproducing results are provided in the launch scripts for each benchmark 
:ir_repo:`here <isaac_ros_benchmark> <benchmarks>`.

Frames per second (fps) are measured using the maximum sustained framerate for the accelerated 
computational pipeline on each listed platforms. Performance measured includes input node → graph
of node(s) under performance test → output node where the publishing rate of the input node is
auto-tuned to discover the peak throughput dropping <5% of the frames. Average fps computed over 5
runs, discarding minimum and maximum runs; latency measured at 30hz publishing rate matching sensor
capture rate.
