Overview
------------

This tutorial walks you through a graph for :ir_repo:`Image Segmentation <isaac_ros_image_segmentation>`
of people using images from Isaac Sim.

Tutorial Walkthrough
--------------------

1.  Complete the :ref:`quickstart <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_image_segmentation/isaac_ros_segformer/index:quickstart>` up until model preparation step.
2.  Activate the Isaac ROS environment:

    .. code:: bash

       isaac-ros activate

3.  Install and launch Isaac Sim following the steps in the :ref:`Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide <gs_isaac_sim>`.
4.  Press **Play** to start publishing data from the Isaac Sim.

5. Run the following launch files to start the inferencing:

    .. code:: bash

           ros2 launch isaac_ros_segformer isaac_ros_people_sem_segformer_isaac_sim.launch.py model_name:=peoplesemsegformer model_repository_paths:=[${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/isaac_ros_assets/models]

6.  In another terminal, install and launch ``rqt_image_view``:

    .. code:: bash

       isaac-ros activate

    .. code:: bash

       sudo apt-get install -y ros-:ir_ros_distro:-rqt-image-view

    Then launch ``rqt_image_view``:

    .. code:: bash

           ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

    To view a colorized segmentation
    mask, inside the ``rqt_image_view`` GUI, change the topic to
    ``/segformer/colored_segmentation_mask``.

    .. note::

        The raw segmentation is also published to
        ``/segformer/raw_segmentation_mask``. However, the raw pixels correspond
        to the class labels and so the output is unsuitable for human visual
        inspection.
