            source ~/.bashrc

Configure Isaac ROS Apt Repository
----------------------------------

The NVIDIA Isaac ROS Apt Repository hosts the following categories of packages for all users:

- Isaac ROS CLI package for managing Isaac ROS development environments
- Pre-built Isaac ROS packages for currently-supported platforms
- Auxiliary packages to improve developer experience or to support a legacy OS

To configure the Isaac ROS Apt Repository, follow the steps below:

#. Set the locale on your host system to UTF-8:

   .. code:: bash

      locale  # check for UTF-8

      sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
      sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
      sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
      export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

      locale  # verify settings

#. Install the dependencies:

   .. code:: bash

      sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg
      sudo apt install software-properties-common
      sudo add-apt-repository universe

#. Source the Isaac ROS Apt Repository:

   Select your platform to see the appropriate APT repository sourcing instructions.

   .. apt_platform_tabs::

Select Environment Isolation Mode
---------------------------------

Based on your use case, decide on an appropriate level of isolation between Isaac ROS and your host system:

.. tip::

   **Docker** is the recommended option for most users. It provides the highest level of isolation from your host system.

   In Virtual Environment or Bare Metal mode, you may need to remove existing packages from your host system to avoid version conflicts with Isaac ROS and its dependencies.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 25 25

   * - Mode
     - Debian packages
     - Python ``pip`` packages
     - Isolation
   * - **Docker (recommended)**
     - Installed inside the container (host unaffected)
     - Installed inside the container (host unaffected)
     - High (full container isolation)
   * - Virtual Environment
     - Installed on host via ``apt``
     - Installed into Isaac ROS virtual environment (isolated from system Python)
     - Medium
   * - Bare Metal
     - Installed on host via ``apt``
     - Installed into system Python ``site-packages``
     - None

This selection will inform subsequent steps in the setup process.

Initialize Isaac ROS CLI
------------------------

#. Install dependencies:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install termcolor --break-system-packages

#. Install the Isaac ROS CLI:

   .. code:: bash

      sudo apt-get install isaac-ros-cli

#. Configure the environment isolation mode you selected earlier:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Docker
         :sync: docker

         #. Install Docker following the `official instructions <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository/>`__.

         #. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit following the `official instructions <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#with-apt-ubuntu-debian>`__.

         #. Configure ``nvidia-container-toolkit`` for Docker using the `official instructions <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#configuring-docker>`__.

         #. Restart Docker:

            .. code:: bash

               sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart docker

         #. Initialize the Isaac ROS CLI:

            .. code:: bash

               sudo isaac-ros init docker

         |

         .. dropdown:: Customizing the Docker Image

               The default Isaac ROS Docker image contains a core set of dependencies for basic Isaac ROS usage.

               To add additional dependencies (e.g., RealSense camera support), refer to the :ref:`Docker Mode Configuration <concepts/dev_env/index:Docker Mode Configuration>` documentation.

      .. tab-item:: Virtual Environment
         :sync: venv

         #. Configure your host environment for Isaac ROS:

            .. include:: _snippets/host_env_setup.rst

         #. Initialize the Isaac ROS CLI:

            .. code:: bash

               sudo isaac-ros init venv

      .. tab-item:: Bare Metal
         :sync: baremetal

         .. caution::

            The ``baremetal`` mode is only recommended for advanced users.

            This mode installs Isaac ROS packages and their dependencies into your system Python environment.

            Without proper care, this has the potential to **break your host system**.

         #. Configure your host environment for Isaac ROS:

            .. include:: _snippets/host_env_setup.rst

         #. Initialize the Isaac ROS CLI:

            .. code:: bash

               sudo isaac-ros init baremetal

            Acknowledge the prompt, then confirm to continue.

            .. dropdown:: Unattended/Non-Interactive Installation

               In some cases, it may be desirable to skip the prompt when initializing the ``baremetal`` mode.

               To perform a non-interactive installation, use the ``--yes`` flag:

               .. code:: bash

                  sudo isaac-ros init baremetal --yes

.. dropdown:: Configuring the Isaac ROS Development Environment

   The Isaac ROS CLI uses layered configuration files to manage settings across all isolation modes.

   To use these configuration files and customize your development environment, refer to the :doc:`Isaac ROS Development Environment </concepts/dev_env/index>` page.

Integrate External Data Sources (Optional)
------------------------------------------

Many Isaac ROS demos include pre-recorded rosbag data to help you get started as quickly as possible.

Optionally, these demos can also be integrated with external data sources, including cameras and the Isaac Sim simulation platform.

.. dropdown:: Sensors

   Isaac ROS provides setup instructions for specific camera models from the following product lines:

   - :doc:`RealSense <sensors/realsense_setup>`
   - :doc:`StereoLabs ZED <sensors/zed_setup>`

   Calibrate your cameras depending on your type of camera and the object it is on:

   - :doc:`Monocular Camera <sensors/camera_calibration>`
   - :doc:`Stereo Camera on Robot Arm <sensors/isaac_for_manipulation_camera_calibration>`
   - :doc:`Stereo Camera on Mobile Robot <sensors/amr_extrinsic_calibration>`

.. dropdown:: Isaac Sim

   .. _gs_isaac_sim:

   `Isaac Sim <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim>`__ is NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform powered by Omniverse.

   Isaac Sim can be used to run and test the ROS 2 applications. There are two ways we can configure the system:

   - **Software in the Loop (SIL)** refers to a configuration where the software being tested is not running on the target hardware platform. For example, Isaac ROS packages being tested on x86 before deployment on a Jetson device is SIL.

   - **Hardware in the Loop (HIL)** refers to a configuration where the software is being tested on the target hardware platform. For example, Isaac ROS packages being tested on a Jetson device before deployment is HIL.

   In both the configurations, Isaac Sim runs on a ``x86_64`` machine providing sensor data and world information.
