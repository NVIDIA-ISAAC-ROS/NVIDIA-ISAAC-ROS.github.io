.. note::

   * It is required to use RealSense firmware `version 5.16.0.1 <https://dev.realsenseai.com/docs/firmware-releases-d400>`__,
     `librealsense SDK` `version v2.56.3 <https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.56.3>`__
     and `realsense-ros` driver `version r/4.56.3 <https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros/tree/r/4.56.3>`__.
     **Any deviation from these versions may break or degrade the performance of Isaac ROS examples.**

   * It is required to use USB3 ports and cables to run the cameras at higher resolutions and frame rates that some applications expect.

   * For best results we suggest increasing the maximum Linux kernel receive buffer size as
     detailed in `DDS tuning <https://docs.ros.org/en/:ir_ros_distro:/How-To-Guides/DDS-tuning.html#cyclone-dds-tuning>`__.

   * The ``realsense-viewer`` tool has performance issues when running multiple cameras on the Jetson platforms. However the RealSense ROS drivers work fine with multiple cameras.

Setup Instructions
------------------

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the instructions in :doc:`Developer Environment Setup </getting_started/index>`.

#. Start with the RealSense camera unplugged. Then, add RealSense udev rules to your host machine.

   .. code:: bash

      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realsenseai/librealsense/v2.56.3/config/99-realsense-libusb.rules && \
      sudo mv 99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ && \
      sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger && echo "Successfully added udev rules"

   Verify that you have ``Successfully added udev rules`` in the output, which indicates all commands were successful.

#. Configure the Isaac ROS environment to include ``librealsense SDK`` and ``realsense-ros``:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Docker
         :sync: docker

         Create a file called ``~/.config/isaac-ros-cli/config.yaml`` with the following content:

         .. code:: bash

            mkdir -p ~/.config/isaac-ros-cli
            touch ~/.config/isaac-ros-cli/config.yaml

         .. code:: yaml

            docker:
              image:
                additional_image_keys:
                  - realsense

      .. tab-item:: Virtual Environment
         :sync: venv

         .. include:: _snippets/realsense_host_setup.rst

      .. tab-item:: Bare Metal
         :sync: baremetal

         .. include:: _snippets/realsense_host_setup.rst

#. Plug in your RealSense camera to USB3 ports before activating the Isaac ROS environment in the next step.

#. Activate the Isaac ROS environment:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Docker
         :sync: docker

         .. code:: bash

            isaac-ros activate --build-local

         This ``--build-local`` flag rebuilds the container image using ``Dockerfile.realsense`` in one of its layered stages. Rebuilding can take several minutes.

         After the image has been built once, you can use ``isaac-ros activate`` to launch the container without rebuilding the image.

      .. tab-item:: Virtual Environment
         :sync: venv

         .. code:: bash

            isaac-ros activate

      .. tab-item:: Bare Metal
         :sync: baremetal

         .. code:: bash

            isaac-ros activate

#. Verify that the RealSense camera is connected by running:

   .. code:: bash

      rs-enumerate-devices

   Verify that this returns information about all connected RealSense cameras.

   .. note::

      The ``realsense-viewer`` tool requires a graphical environment, to use it you must connect the host to a monitor, use a remote desktop connection or similar.

   .. code:: bash

      realsense-viewer

   If you turn on the "Stereo Module" in the GUI, verify that you have something like the following:

   .. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/getting_started/realsense_viewer.png>`
      :align: center

If you come across issues, see if it's covered in :doc:`/troubleshooting/hardware_setup` or ``librealsense`` SDK `issues <https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/issues?q=is%3Aissue>`__.
