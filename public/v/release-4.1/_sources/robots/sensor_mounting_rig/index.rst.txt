Sensor Mounting Rig
===================

Thor Developer Kit RealSense Rig
--------------------------------

The rig supports hardware mounting of three Intel RealSense cameras (D435/D455) on the Jetson Thor Developer Kit at known nominal positions.

URDF files with the camera nominal positions on the rig are provided in the :ir_repo:`thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description <sensor_mounting_rig> <thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description>` package:

- :ir_repo:`thor_devkit_realsense_rig_d455.urdf.xacro <sensor_mounting_rig> <thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description/urdf/thor_devkit_realsense_rig_d455.urdf.xacro>`
- :ir_repo:`thor_devkit_realsense_rig_d435.urdf.xacro <sensor_mounting_rig> <thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description/urdf/thor_devkit_realsense_rig_d435.urdf.xacro>`

To load and use these URDF files, you may refer to the launch file: :ir_repo:`thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description.launch.py <sensor_mounting_rig> <thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description/launch/thor_devkit_realsense_rig_description.launch.py>` to publish the camera relative positions and orientations.
