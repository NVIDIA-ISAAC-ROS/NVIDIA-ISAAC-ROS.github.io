AMCL Tuning
-----------
Compared to the default parameters of AMCL we made the following changes to
improve localization performance:

1. Used the ``beam`` laser_model_type instead of the default "likelihood_field"
   laser_model_type

2. Reduced the ``z_hit`` Gaussian model sigma(``sigma_hit``) to 0.1

3. Set the ``beam`` laser_model_type weights to ``z_hit``: 0.5, ``z_max``: 0.05,
   ``z_rand``: 0.4 and ``z_short``: 0.05

4. Increased the ``max_beams`` parameter from ``60`` to ``360`` to allow for
   more detailed features to be used by AMCL

5. Decreased all odometry process noise from ``0.2`` to ``0.1`` to allow higher
   confidence in the robot's wheel odometry
