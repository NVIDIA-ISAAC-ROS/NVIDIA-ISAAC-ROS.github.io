Isaac ROS Hawk Setup
======================

Leopard Imaging's `Hawk <https://leopardimaging.com/leopard-imaging-hawk-stereo-camera/>`__ camera is a popular choice of stereo camera for use with the Isaac ROS ecosystem of packages. This document details important setup instructions for configuring the Hawk camera with Isaac ROS.

.. note::

    For best results, you must update the camera's firmware.

.. note::

    Hawk stereo cameras through Argus are only supported on Jetson platforms


Jetson Platforms
----------------

Camera Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hawk camera must be connected to your Jetson via a GMSL expansion board. If using `Leopard Imaging's P3762_A03 board <https://leopardimaging.com/product/accessories/adapters-carrier-boards/for-nvidia-jetson/li-jag-adp-gmsl2-8ch/>`__ you can set up Hawk by :ir_nova_docs:`installing Nova Init <nova_init/index.html#install>`.

For other GMSL boards please contact your vendor for information on how to configure them.

Verifying Hawk Set Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hawk can be verified with Argus by building and running ``argus_syncstereo``:

.. code:: bash

    cd /usr/src/jetson_multimedia_api/argus/cmake/
    sudo cmake ..
    sudo make install
    argus_syncstereo

This should run without error.

ROS Driver Setup
----------------

1. Clone the ``isaac_ros_argus_camera`` repositories that contains the Hawk camera ROS driver:

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src && \
    git clone :ir_clone:`<isaac_ros_argus_camera>`
