Restarting the Argus Daemon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Argus <https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/l4t-multimedia/group__LibargusAPI.html>`_ is a library used by
Isaac ROS on NVIDIA Jetson systems. It runs a daemon independent of ROS in a separate process to manage the camera.
If you are having any sort of trouble with the camera, one of the first things you should try is restarting this daemon. From outside the container you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon.service


This can resolve ``(Argus) Error EndOfFile`` and ``Failed to create capture session`` errors, among others.
Generally these errors are caused by improper shutdown of a camera application.


Re-probing camera modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are still having trouble with the camera, for example if restarting the daemon does not resolve a ``Failed to create capture session`` error, you can try re-probing the camera modules.
This can be done from outside the container by running the following

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo modprobe -r cam_cdi_tsc
    sudo modprobe -r nv_hawk_owl
    sudo modprobe nv_hawk_owl
    sudo modprobe cam_cdi_tsc
    sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon.service
