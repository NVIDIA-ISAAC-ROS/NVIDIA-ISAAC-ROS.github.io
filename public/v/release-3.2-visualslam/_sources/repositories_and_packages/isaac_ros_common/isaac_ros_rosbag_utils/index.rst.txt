Overview
========

This package contains utilities for working with rosbags.

EDEX Extraction
---------------

EDEX is a data format that is used by cuVSLAM for offline processing. This
package contains a tool to extract an EDEX dataset from a rosbag.

The tool can be used like:

.. code:: bash
    
    ros2 run isaac_ros_rosbag_utils extract_edex \
        --config_path <path/to/config/file> \
        --rosbag_path <path/to/rosbag> \
        --edex_path <path/to/edex>
    
Here ``<path/to/config/file>`` is the path to a YAML config file that contains
information about which topics should be extracted. For example:

.. code:: yaml

    camera_info_topics:
    - /my/camera/camera_info
    image_topics:
    - /my/camera/image_raw

``<path/to/rosbag>`` is the path where the existing rosbag is stored on disk,
``<path/to/edex>`` is the path where the new EDEX dataset will be generated.

For more information on the EDEX extraction tool run

.. code:: bash

    ros2 run isaac_ros_rosbag_utils extract_edex --help

.. |package_name| replace:: ``isaac_ros_rosbag_utils``
