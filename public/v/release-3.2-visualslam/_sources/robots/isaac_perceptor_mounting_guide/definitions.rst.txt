Coordinate Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AMR Coordinate System
*********************

**Coordinates Orientation**

The AMR employs a Right Handed Coordinate
System. The AMR forward direction is aligned with the positive X direction.

**X Direction**

X positive points to the AMR front direction, X is parallel to the
ground in typical AMR conditions.

**Y Direction**

Y positive points to the AMR left direction, Y is parallel to the ground
in typical AMR conditions.

**Z Direction**

Z positive points to the AMR up direction, Z is perpendicular to the
ground in typical AMR conditions.

**Coordinates Origin**

The coordinates origin or vertex is fixed to the AMR body at the
foremost AMR surface on X Direction, center of the body width on Y
Direction, and ground surface on the Z Direction in typical AMR
conditions.

**Roll Direction**

Roll positive is the direction rotating Y
Direction for 90 degrees to fully align with Z Direction.

**Pitch Direction**

Pitch positive is the direction rotating Z Direction for
90 degrees to fully align with X Direction.

**Yaw Direction**

Yaw positive is the direction rotating X Direction for
90 degrees to fully align with Y Direction.

**Roll Range**

Roll range is (-180,180] in degree.

**Pitch Range**

Pitch range is [-90,90] in degree.

**Yaw Range**

Yaw range is (-180,180] in degree.

**Rotation**

Sub-linked parts in AMR Coordinate
System have global extrinsic rotations in the order of Roll
Direction, Pitch Direction and Yaw Direction.

The rotation matrix R is defined as following, r is Roll in degree, p is
Pitch in degree and y is Yaw in degree.

**Linear Translation**

Linear translation applies to sub-linked parts
after Rotation.

For example, a sub-linked stereo camera has
x\ :sub:`Δoffset`, y\ :sub:`Δoffset`, z\ :sub:`Δoffset` (from Coordinates
Origin to stereo-camera Vertex) as linear translation and R as
the Rotation  matrix in AMR Coordinate System.
A detected point [x:sub:`a`, y\ :sub:`a`, z\ :sub:`a`] from the
perspective of the stereo camera has its position at [x:sub:`b`,
y\ :sub:`b`, z\ :sub:`b`] from the perspective of the Vehicle Coordinate System.
