Overview
--------

In robotics, the term "manipulator" has traditionally had a very broad definition, referring not only
to robots used for repositioning or modifying physical objects but also to robot arms generally, even
when used in non-contact applications such as automated optical inspection.  Increasingly, robotic
manipulators are being used for tasks where their motion must adapt to changing conditions as
perceived via cameras or other sensors.

An example of perception-driven manipulation is unstructured picking, where the robot might be tasked
with picking a variety of objects whose positions are not known in advance.  This requires modules
to detect a given object, determine its pose, compute a suitable grasp (dependent on the installed gripper),
plan a trajectory to bring the gripper to the desired pose while avoiding collisions, execute the planned
trajectory, grasp the object, and finally plan a trajectory to the desired place point, all in real time.
More challenging scenarios might require the planner to adapt to a changing environment where the presence
and positions of obstacles also vary.

`Isaac Manipulator <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/manipulator>`_ consists of a set of components and
:doc:`reference workflows </reference_workflows/isaac_manipulator/index>` for advanced perception-driven
manipulation.  These components include state-of-the-art packages for
:doc:`object detection </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_object_detection/index>` and
:doc:`object pose estimation </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_pose_estimation/index>`, as well as
obstacle-aware motion generation, described in more detail below.

NVIDIA cuMotion
---------------

`NVIDIA cuMotion` is a software package for computing optimal-time, minimal-jerk trajectories for serial robot arms.
It is capable of avoiding collisions with obstacles represented as a set of cuboids, meshes, signed distance fields
(computed from one or more depth image streams using :doc:`nvblox </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/index>`),
or any combination of the three.  cuMotion leverages NVIDIA hardware acceleration to compute such trajectories in
a fraction of a second on Jetson AGX Orin or tens of milliseconds on a discrete GPU such as RTX 6000 (Ada Generation).

In the current release, the planning capabilities of cuMotion are exposed via a plugin for
`MoveIt 2 <https://moveit.picknik.ai>`_.  In addition, a ROS 2 node is provided that uses the current joint
configuration of the robot to perform segmentation in order to filter out the robot from a depth image,
as needed to reconstruct obstacles in the environment without spurious contributions from the robot itself.

cuMotion incorporates technology developed by `NVIDIA Research <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/>`_ and
leverages the `cuRobo library <https://curobo.org>`_ internally.

See :doc:`Isaac ROS cuMotion </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_cumotion/index>` for more on cuMotion
and instructions for getting started.


Robot Configuration
-------------------

In order to generate motion or perform segmentation for a given robot, cuMotion requires two files:

1. A universal/unified robot description format (URDF) file, describing basic kinematics.
2. An extended robot description format (XRDF) file, supplementing the URDF file with collision geometry
   (as a set of collision spheres), a definition of the configuration space (c-space) used for planning,
   potential modifiers to the URDF file, and other such data.

See the following specification for details on XRDF.

   xrdf.rst

For convenience, a visual
`Robot Description Editor <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/advanced_tutorials/tutorial_motion_generation_robot_description_editor.html>`_
with XRDF support is available in Isaac Sim 4.0 and later.

.. warning::

   In the current release, ``isaac_ros_cumotion`` also accepts robot description files in a legacy
   `cuRobo format <https://curobo.org/tutorials/1_robot_configuration.html>`_,
   but this support will be discontinued in a future release.  Please use XRDF instead.


Grasp Authoring
---------------

With the capability to identify specific objects in the world along with their poses, the process
of computing high quality grasps between a specific gripper and object can be taken offline.  An
`isaac_grasp` file is a YAML file that follows a human-readable format for storing predefined
grasps.

See the following specification for details on `isaac_grasp` files.

   isaac_grasp.rst

For convenience, Isaac Sim 4.2 and later includes a
`Grasp Editor <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/advanced_tutorials/tutorial_grasp_editor.html>`__
that supports hand authoring grasps and exporting them to an `isaac_grasp` file.  Additionally, it supports importing
an `isaac_grasp` file for the purpose of visualizing and validating the included grasps.


Pick and Place
--------------

The `Pick and Place` workflow is a reference implementation for perception-driven manipulation using Isaac ROS packages.
It demonstrates how to use the :doc:`Isaac ROS Object Detection </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_object_detection/index>` and :doc:`Isaac ROS Pose Estimation </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_pose_estimation/index>`
packages to detect objects and estimate their poses, respectively, and how to use :doc:`Isaac ROS cuMotion </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_cumotion/index>` to plan and
execute trajectories for picking and placing objects.

See the following :doc:`page </reference_workflows/isaac_manipulator/tutorials/tutorial_pick_and_place>` for more information on the `Pick and Place` reference workflow.
