Overview
------------

The Isaac ROS Jetson Stats package wraps the output from the `jetson_stats <https://rnext.it/jetson_stats>`__ package and publishes a diagnostic message with the status of your device.
It remaps all board statuses to the desired format for more accessible analysis and monitoring.
