Creating Graphs with NITROS-Accelerated Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides the fully tested :ref:`graphs <concepts/nitros/index:NITROS-Accelerated Graphs>`,
it is also possible to construct your own graphs with any of the Isaac ROS NITROS-accelerated
nodes to enjoy the performance benefit of NITROS.

The key to successfully constructing a NITROS-accelerated graph is to
ensure that all NITROS-accelerated nodes start in the same process
(which permits zero-copy between nodes). To do so, follow the steps
below to create your own launch file:

#. Create a Python ROS 2 launch file following the official
   `guide <https://docs.ros.org/en/:ir_ros_distro:/How-To-Guides/Launching-composable-nodes.html>`__.

#. Create NITROS-accelerated nodes using ``ComposableNode``. Taking
   ``RealSenseNode`` and ``RectifyNode`` as an example, the nodes can be
   created as follows:

   .. code:: python

      realsense_node = ComposableNode(
          name='realsense_node',
          package='realsense2_camera',
          plugin='realsense2_camera::RealSenseNodeFactory',
      )

      rectify_node = ComposableNode(
          name='rectify_node',
          package='isaac_ros_image_proc',
          plugin='nvidia::isaac_ros::image_proc::RectifyNode',
          parameters=[{
              'output_width': 1920,
              'output_height': 1200,
          }],
          remapping=[
              ('image_raw', 'left/image_raw'),
              ('camera_info', 'left/camera_info')
          ],
      )

#. Place the created nodes in ``ComposableNodeContainer``:

   .. code:: python

      nitros_container = ComposableNodeContainer(
          name='nitros_container',
          package='rclcpp_components',
          executable='component_container_mt',
          composable_node_descriptions=[realsense_node, rectify_node],
      )

   ..

      **Note:** It is crucial that the ``executable`` field is set to be
      ``component_container_mt`` so that the created nodes can be
      started and communicated correctly within the same process.

#. Finally, place the created composable node container in
   ``LaunchDescription`` to finalize the launch script.

   .. code:: python

      return launch.LaunchDescription([nitros_container])


Using NITROS-Accelerated Nodes in Existing Non-NITROS Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to use any NITROS-accelerated nodes in an existing
ROS 2 graph, as all Isaac ROS nodes are compatible with non-NITROS ROS 2
nodes.

Follow these steps to integrate one or more NITROS-accelerated nodes
into your graph:

#. Follow the same steps introduced in the :ref:`previous section <Creating Graphs with NITROS-Accelerated Nodes>` to create
   a ``ComposableNodeContainer`` that contains all the
   NITROS-accelerated nodes with multi-thread enabled
   (i.e. ``executable='component_container_mt'``).

#. Place the created composable node container in ``LaunchDescription``
   together with your own, regular ROS 2 node or composable node
   container declarations.

Now the NITROS-accelerated nodes will be able to choose the best
compatible way to communicate with their adjacent nodes.

-  When connected to non-NITROS nodes, NITROS-accelerated nodes will
   function like regular ROS 2 nodes.
-  When connected to NITROS-accelerated nodes, zero-copy data
   transmission via type adaptation and type negotiation will be
   adopted.

Please visit the link below for an example graph that consists of
NITROS-accelerated and non-NITROS nodes:

-  :doc:`NITROS-accelerated AprilTag node + non-NITROS USB camera node </concepts/fiducials/apriltag/tutorial_usb_cam>`

.. note::

   NITROS nodes enable `CUDA memory pool <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__MEMORY__POOLS.html>`__ by default. To disable it, set the
   environment variable ``DISABLE_NITROS_CUDA_MEM_POOL`` parameter to ``true``.

Enabling diagnostics for NITROS Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NITROS Nodes allow the publishing of diagnostics to the ``/diagnostics`` topic.
The diagnostic messages are published using ``diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray``.
Therefore, they are compatible with `ros2 diagnostics <https://github.com/ros/diagnostics>`__.
Diagnostics published are:

-  ``frame_rate_msg``: Windowed mean frame rate calculated using the message timestamp
-  ``frame_rate_node``: Windowed mean frame rate calculated using the node clock
-  ``mean_abs_jitter_msg``: Mean absolute jitter calculated using the message timestamp
-  ``mean_abs_jitter_node``: Mean absolute jitter calculated using the node clock
-  ``max_abs_jitter_msg``: Maximum absolute jitter calculated using the message timestamp
-  ``max_abs_jitter_node``: Maximum absolute jitter calculated using the node clock
-  ``num_non_increasing_msg``: Number of messages with non-increasing message times
-  ``num_jitter_outliers_msg``: Number of messages outside the jitter tolerance using the message timestamp
-  ``num_jitter_outliers_node``: Number of messages outside the jitter tolerance using the node clock
-  ``total_dropped_frames``: Currently equivalent to ``num_jitter_outliers_msg``. Accurate only for topics with low jitter (such as a stereo camera and IMU)

Jitter is the deviation in time between messages as compared to the expected FPS and it is
measured using the node clock or the message timestamps. Units are in microseconds.
Stats ending in ``_msg`` use the timestamp in the header of the message, often reflecting a sensor acquisition timestamp.
Stats ending in ``_node`` use the node's clock to note the timestamp when publishing/receiving.
To enable publishing to ``/diagnostics``, set one or more of ``enable_msg_time_diagnostics``, ``enable_increasing_msg_time_diagnostics`` and ``enable_node_time_diagnostics``.
Following are parameters associated with publishing `/diagnostics`.

``enable_node_time_diagnostics``           ``bool``           ``False``     Enable diagnostics publishing using message timestamps (``_node`` stats).
``enable_msg_time_diagnostics``            ``bool``           ``False``     Enable diagnostics publishing using node clock (``_msg`` stats).
``enable_increasing_msg_time_diagnostics`` ``bool``           ``False``     Enable tracking and identification of non-monotonic timestamps on messages.
``diagnostics_publish_rate``               ``float``          ``1.0``       Frequency at which diagnostics are published to ``/diagnostics``
``filter_window_size``                     ``int``            ``100``       Window size of the mean filter in terms of number of messages received
``topics_list``                            ``vector<string>`` ``[]``        A list of names of topics we want the NITROS node to track diagnostics of. Use pre-remapping names and not the re-mapped topic names.
``expected_fps_list``                      ``vector<float>``  ``[]``        Each topic's expected frames per seconds. Length of list must match number of topics passed into the previous parameter.
========================================== ================== ============= ====================================================================================================================================

Additionally, one can enable publishing FPS for all by setting the ``ENABLE_GLOBAL_NITROS_DIAGNOSTICS``
environment variable to 1 before launching the node. This will enable FPS diagnostics for all, while
still publishing drop rates and other data for nodes with expected topics and expected FPS.

You can view these topics with the following utility:

.. code:: bash

   ros2 run isaac_ros_nitros diagnostic_viewer.py
