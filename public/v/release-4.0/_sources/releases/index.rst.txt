Isaac ROS 0.10.0 DP (Developer Preview) June 30, 2022
-----------------------------------------------------

Packages available as ``DP Release`` tagged ``v0.10.0-dp``.


What's New
~~~~~~~~~~

ROS 2 Humble release of Isaac ROS with performance boost and new stereo
perception functions including:

- packages for ROS 2 Humble (Foxy deprecated) on JetPack 5.0.1 DP
- support for Jetson Orin
- support for Isaac Sim 2022.1 *(Isaac SIM 2021.2 is deprecated)*
- ``isaac_ros_nitros``: Implement type adaptation and type negotiation features new to Humble boosting performance
- ``isaac_ros_depth_segmentation``: For stereo vision detection of obstacles during navigation
- ``isaac_ros_dnn_stereo_depth``: For stereo vision AI prediction of depth


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are known limitations with this release, that
might have additional details for workarounds in the troubleshooting
section:

- Isaac SIM 2022.1 released in June 2022 will add support for Humble in September. Incompatibilities exist when performing SIL (software in the loop) simulation with Isaac ROS.
- RealSense drivers as-is do not support Humble, but can be modified to work.
- ``isaac_ros_nvblox`` is untested with Nav2 on Humble.
- Removed CenterPose support on Jetson.
- ``isaac_ros_ess`` throws an error if using rosbag as input, and input topics are published after the node is started.
