Validating Isaac ROS Visual SLAM on a Robot
===========================================

Overview
------------

This document outlines a procedure that can be used to validate the
successful installation and configuration of Isaac ROS Visual SLAM on
real hardware.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  [ ] NVIDIA Jetson
-  [ ] Standalone computer with ROS data visualization tool (RViz, Foxglove, etc.)
-  [ ] Compatible stereo camera
-  [ ] Enough space to navigate (~40m loop)
-  [ ] Tape measure

Prepare Physical Environment
----------------------------

1. Examine the designated testing area and identify a single,
   non-intersecting loop whose path length is approximately 40 meters.
   This is the path along which the camera is moved and tracked
   using Isaac ROS Visual SLAM.

2. Define a starting pose along the identified loop. Label this pose
   with masking tape or a different marker.

   One possible approach is to mark an L-shape on the floor, aligning
   the camera's position and orientation to the corner of the shape.

3. Using a measuring tool, measure out a secondary pose along the loop
   that is exactly 1 meter along the forward axis from the starting
   pose. Label this pose in the same manner.

Download and Configure Packages
-----------------------------------

1. On each of the Jetson and standalone computers, set up your
   development environment by following the
   :doc:`dev setup instructions </getting_started/index>`.

   .. note::

     ``${ISAAC_ROS_WS}`` is defined to point to
     ``/ssd/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/`` or
     ``~/workspaces/isaac_ros-dev/``.

2. Set up your stereo camera and connect it to the Jetson:

   -  For RealSense cameras, complete the :doc:`RealSense setup tutorial </getting_started/sensors/realsense_setup>`.

3. On both devices, clone this repository under ``${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src``.

    .. code:: bash

       cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src

    .. code:: bash

       git clone :ir_clone:`<isaac_ros_visual_slam>`


Build ROS Workspace
-------------------

1. On the Jetson, activate the Isaac ROS environment in a new terminal:

   .. code:: bash

      isaac-ros activate

2. Inside the container, install this package's dependencies.

   :ir_apt:

   .. code:: bash

      sudo apt-get install -y ros-:ir_ros_distro:-isaac-ros-visual-slam

Select and Start ROS Visualization Tool
---------------------------------------

1. Ensure that the standalone computer and Jetson device are on the same
   network.

2. On the standalone computer, start RViz from the provided
   configuration file:

   Start the Isaac ROS environment for RViz on the standalone computer:

   .. code:: bash

      isaac-ros activate

3. **(Optional)** Configure the ``ROS_DOMAIN_ID`` environment
   variable on both devices to eliminate any cross-talk from other
   ROS nodes on the same network.

   In each terminal on each device:

   .. code:: bash

      export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=5 # Any number between 1-101; use the same number for each terminal

   .. note::

      This environment variable must be set in each terminal,
      on both the Jetson and the standalone computer.

   From this terminal, run RViz2 to display the output:

   .. code:: bash

      rviz2 -d $(ros2 pkg prefix isaac_ros_visual_slam --share)/rviz/default.cfg.rviz

4. On the standalone computer, start logging the estimated transform:

   Attach another terminal to the running container for ``tf2_echo``:

   .. code:: bash

      isaac-ros activate

   From this terminal, run ``tf2_echo`` to display the transform between
   the ``/map`` frame and the appropriate base frame:

   -  RealSense: ``/camera_link``

   .. code:: bash

      ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base

Run Isaac ROS Visual SLAM and Monitor Results
---------------------------------------------

Visual Odometry Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this test is to validate that the system is able to
provide accurate measurements of the robot's local motion.

1. Initialize the camera at the marked starting pose.

2. On the Jetson, run the Isaac ROS Visual SLAM launch file:

   -  RealSense:

      .. code:: bash

         ros2 launch isaac_ros_visual_slam isaac_ros_visual_slam_realsense.launch.py


   The ``/map``, ``/odom``, and camera frames must all be
   initialized to the starting pose.

3. Carefully move the camera straight forward to the marked secondary
   pose.

4. On the standalone computer and within the ``tf2_echo`` terminal, note
   the latest transform reported between ``/map`` and the appropriate
   camera frame.

      :align: center
      :width: 600px

   1. Validate orientation:

      Validate that the orientation error between the measured rotation unit
      quaternion and the expected rotation unit quaternion
      (``[0 0 0 1]``) is less than 15 degrees. This error can be
      calculated using the process explained
      `here <https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/-/snippets/190>`__:

      .. math:: q_{measured} = w_m + x_m i + y_m j + z_m k

      .. math:: q_{expected} = w_e + x_e i + y_e j + z_e k

      .. math:: 2 \arccos(w_m w_e + x_m x_e + y_m y_e + z_m z_e) \leq 15 \degree

   2. Validate translation:

      Verify that the magnitude of the measured translation is within 5
      centimeters of the expected translation (1 meter):

      .. math::  0.95 \text{m} \leq \|t_{measured}\| \leq 1.05 \text{m}

If all real-world measurements correspond to the reported estimates
within the expected tolerance, the Visual Odometry test is a success.

Loop Closure Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this test is to validate that the system is able to
appropriately realign the estimated pose path to previously-seen
features.

1. Initialize the camera at the marked starting pose.

2. On the Jetson, run the Isaac ROS Visual SLAM launch file:

   -  RealSense:

      .. code:: bash

         ros2 launch isaac_ros_visual_slam isaac_ros_visual_slam_realsense.launch.py

   Validate that the ``/map``, ``/odom``, and camera frames are all
   initialized to the starting pose.

3. Carefully move the camera along the predetermined 40m path.

   .. note::

      To maximize the accuracy of this test, ensure that
      dynamic obstacles are removed from the robot's field of view. If a
      nontrivial dynamic obstacle is introduced while the robot is
      performing the loop, you must restart this test.

4. As the camera nears the completion of its first lap, move the camera
   in a small circle with the radius of ~0.5m around the origin of the starting
   pose. This step helps ensure that the previously-seen visual features
   are recognized and matched.

5. Place the camera at rest, taking care to precisely align it with the
   floor marker indicating the starting pose.

6. On the standalone computer and within the RViz window, ensure that a
   nontrivial number of visual features now appear red. Additionally,
   ensure that the camera frame appears nearly coincident with the
   ``/map`` frame.

      .. note::

         It is acceptable for the ``/odom`` frame to jump around
         significantly with respect to the ``/map`` frame. For the purposes
         of this test, only the transform between the ``/map`` and camera
         frames is relevant. For additional information about the design
         intent behind these frames, see
         `REP-0105 <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html>`__.

7. On the standalone computer and within the ``tf2_echo`` terminal, note
   the latest transform reported between ``/map`` and the appropriate
   camera frame.

   1. Validate orientation:

      Validate that the orientation error between the measured rotation unit
      quaternion and the expected rotation unit quaternion
      (``[0 0 0 1]``, because the path is a closed loop) is less
      than 15 degrees. This error can be calculated using the process
      explained `here <https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/-/snippets/190>`__:

      .. math:: q_{measured} = w_m + x_m i + y_m j + z_m k

      .. math:: q_{expected} = w_e + x_e i + y_e j + z_e k

      .. math:: 2 \arccos (w_m w_e + x_m x_e + y_m y_e + z_m z_e) \leq 15 \degree

   2. Validate translation:

      Validate that the magnitude of the measured translation is within 2
      meters (5% of the 40m path length) of the expected translation (0
      meters, because the path is a closed loop):

      .. math::  0 \text{m} \leq \|t_{measured}\| \leq 2 \text{m}

If all real-world measurements correspond to the reported estimates
within the expected tolerance, the Loop Closure test is a success.

Next Steps
----------

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If any step of the tests did not succeed, then there might be a
configuration error with your system. Follow these
:ref:`troubleshooting <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_visual_slam/isaac_ros_visual_slam/index:Troubleshooting>` suggestions.

If the prepared troubleshooting steps are unable to resolve the test
failure, contact your NVIDIA support representative and file an
issue report with all relevant details.

Integrating Isaac ROS Visual SLAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the Isaac ROS Visual SLAM node exposes a :ref:`multitude of
interfaces <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_visual_slam/isaac_ros_visual_slam/index:API>`,
the core way to consume the node's output is through the reported
transform between the ``/map`` and ``base`` frame.

Based on your robot's precise specifications, you can set up a static
transform publisher or URDF-based publisher that connects the camera
frame to a relevant planning frame on the robot (typically named
``/base_link``). Then, your navigation stack can use the transform
between ``/base_link`` and ``/map`` to plan movements within the local
space.

Consider further augmenting your robot's navigation stack with other
Isaac ROS packages, such as :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS Nvblox <isaac_ros_nvblox>` for 3D
reconstruction.
