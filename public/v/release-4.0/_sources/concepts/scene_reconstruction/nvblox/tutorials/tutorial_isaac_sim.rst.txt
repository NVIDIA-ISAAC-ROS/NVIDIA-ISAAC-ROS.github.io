This page contains tutorials for running :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS Nvblox <isaac_ros_nvblox>`
on simulated data streaming out of Isaac Sim.
The tutorial builds a reconstruction from simulated (depth) image data.
The reconstruction is converted to a 2D costmap that is passed to
`Nav2 <https://nav2.org/>`__ and used for navigation.
The tutorial describes options for using :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS Visual SLAM <isaac_ros_visual_slam>`
and :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS DNN Stereo Depth <isaac_ros_dnn_stereo_depth>` for pose and depth
estimation respectively, and for `reconstruction in the presence of people <#reconstruction-with-people>`_
and `other dynamic objects <#reconstruction-with-dynamic-scene-elements>`_.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

Simulating the scene and robot sensors requires an RTX-enabled GPU
of sufficient capability and memory capacity. In particular, we recommend an "ideal" machine in the
`Isaac Sim requirements <https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/requirements.html>`__.

.. note::

   The sample scene is at the path:

   .. code:: bash

      https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/5.1/Isaac/Samples/NvBlox/nvblox_sample_scene.usd

   It simulates the output for a 3d lidar and three stereo cameras (depth + color images) by default.
   If your system is experiencing compute or memory issue while running the scene, disabling
   `Isaac Create Render Product <https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/py/source/extensions/isaacsim.core.nodes/docs/ogn/OgnIsaacCreateRenderProduct.html>`__
   for some of the sensors can reduce the system load.

Prerequisites
-------------

These are the steps common to running all Nvblox examples in Isaac Sim. You must:

1. Complete the :doc:`/getting_started/index`.

2. Complete the :ref:`Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide <gs_isaac_sim>`.

Install
-------

1. Complete the :ref:`nvblox quickstart <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_ros_nvblox/index:Quickstart>`.

Isaac Sim Example
-----------------

This example runs a nvblox-based reconstruction with Isaac Sim
supplying images, ground-truth depth, and poses from Isaac Sim.
The reconstruction is used for navigation with `Nav2 <https://nav2.org/>`__.

- **Terminal #1:**

   1. Opening a terminal from the Isaac Sim launcher GUI, as described in
      :ref:`Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide <gs_isaac_sim>`.

   2. Start the simulation by running:

      .. code:: bash

         ./isaac-sim.sh

   3. Open the scene at the path:
   
   .. code:: bash

      https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/5.1/Isaac/Samples/NvBlox/nvblox_sample_scene.usd

   4. Play the scene to start the ROS communication from sim.

- **Terminal #2:**

   1. Activate the Isaac ROS environment (if not started in the install step):

      .. code:: bash

         isaac-ros activate

   2. Navigate (inside the Isaac ROS environment) to the workspace folder and source the workspace:

      .. code:: bash

         cd /workspaces/isaac_ros-dev
         source install/setup.bash

   3.  Install ``nav2`` for enabling navigation.

         .. code:: bash

            sudo apt-get install -y ros-:ir_ros_distro:-nav2-bringup ros-:ir_ros_distro:-nav2-route

   4. Install and set the environment variable for Cyclone DDS:

      .. code:: bash

            sudo apt-get install -y ros-:ir_ros_distro:-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
            export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp

   5. Launch the example:

      .. code:: bash

         ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup isaac_sim_example.launch.py

- **In RViz**

   1. Click on the **2D Goal Pose** button. Validate that you see the mesh,
      costmap, and the robot moving towards the goal location, as
      shown at the top of this page.


Selecting the Sensors
---------------------

Nvblox can integrate data from 3d lidar and up to 3 cameras simultaneously.

To enable the 3d lidar or more cameras you may use the ``lidar`` and ``num_cameras`` arguments by
modifying the following command from `Isaac Sim Example <#isaac-sim-example>`_:

- **Terminal #2:**

   3. Launch the example:

      .. code:: bash

         ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup isaac_sim_example.launch.py \
         lidar:=<"lidar"> num_cameras:=<"num_cameras">

      where `"lidar"` can be set to ``True`` to enable 3d lidar and
      `"num_cameras"` is either 0, 1 or 3.
      Setting `"num_cameras"` to 1 will enable the front stereo camera (default)
      and setting it to 3 will enable the side stereo cameras additionally.

Reconstruction With People
--------------------------

    :width: 600px
    :align: center

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform dynamic people
reconstruction in Nvblox using ground-truth people segmentation from Isaac Sim.
For more information on how people reconstruction works, see
:doc:`/concepts/scene_reconstruction/nvblox/technical_details`.

To run this example modify the following commands from `Isaac Sim Example <#isaac-sim-example>`_:

- **Terminal #1:**

   1. Opening a terminal from the Isaac Sim launcher GUI, as described in
      :ref:`Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide <gs_isaac_sim>`.

   2. Start the simulation by running:

      .. code:: bash

         ./isaac-sim.sh

   3. Open the scene at the path:
   
   .. code:: bash

      https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/5.1/Isaac/Samples/NvBlox/nvblox_sample_scene.usd

   4. Toggle `/World/Humans` to choose to have the scene with people.

   5. Play the scene to start the ROS communication from sim.

   .. note::

      Because the animation requires execution of Python
      scripts, running the scene with the UI asks you
      to confirm that you want to enable script execution. Click Yes to
      make it possible to start the scene and the people animation.

- **Terminal #2:**

   3. Launch the example:

      .. code:: bash

         ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup isaac_sim_example.launch.py \
         mode:=people_segmentation num_cameras:=1

   .. note::

      Multi-camera and lidar data integration is not supported in ``people_segmentation`` mode.

Reconstruction With Dynamic Scene Elements
------------------------------------------

.. figure:: :ir_lfs:`<resources/isaac_ros_docs/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/isaac_sim_dynamic_example.gif>`
    :width: 600px
    :align: center

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a reconstruction with dynamic elements in the scene (people and non-people)
using Isaac Sim data. For more information about how dynamic reconstruction works in Nvblox see
:doc:`/concepts/scene_reconstruction/nvblox/technical_details`.

To run this example modify the following commands from `Isaac Sim Example <#isaac-sim-example>`_:

- **Terminal #1:**

   1. Opening a terminal from the Isaac Sim launcher GUI, as described in
      :ref:`Isaac ROS Isaac Sim Setup Guide <gs_isaac_sim>`.

   2. Start the simulation by running:

      .. code:: bash

         ./isaac-sim.sh

   3. Open the scene at the path:
   
   .. code:: bash

      https://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/5.1/Isaac/Samples/NvBlox/nvblox_sample_scene.usd

   4. Toggle `/World/Dynamics` to choose to have the scene with dynamics.

   5. Play the scene to start the ROS communication from sim.

- **Terminal #2:**

   3. Launch the example:

      .. code:: bash

         ros2 launch nvblox_examples_bringup isaac_sim_example.launch.py \
         mode:=dynamic

   .. note::

      Lidar data integration is not supported in dynamic mode.


Running on a Custom Scene
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test the reconstruction on another scene:

-  Make sure you use the same robot USD so that the topic names and Isaac Sim ROS
   bridge is correctly set up.

-  Make sure that humans you add to the scene have the ``person``
   semantic segmentation class. To do so, you can use the Semantics
   Schema Editor on the top prim of the additional humans.
