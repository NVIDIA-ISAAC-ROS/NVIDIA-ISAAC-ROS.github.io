Isaac Sim Setup
===============

`Isaac Sim <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim>`__ is NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform
powered by Omniverse.

Isaac Sim can be used to run and test the ROS 2 applications. There are two ways we can configure the system.

- Software in the Loop
- Hardware in the Loop
  
Software in the Loop (SIL) refers to a configuration where the software
being tested is not running on the target hardware platform. For
example, Isaac ROS packages being tested on x86 before deployment on a Jetson device is SIL.

Hardware in the Loop (HIL) refers to a configuration where the software 
is being tested on the target hardware platform. 
For example, Isaac ROS packages being tested on a Jetson device before deployment is HIL.

In both the configurations, Isaac Sim always runs on a ``x86_64`` machine providing sensor data and world information.
