ZED cameras require the following to be able to publish data to ROS 2 topics:

1. ZED SDK (Step 5 of Setup Instructions)
2. ``zed-ros2-wrapper`` (Cloned in Step 1 of Setup Instructions)
3. ZED X driver (Installed by user on host machine in Step 3 of Setup Instructions)

Camera Compatibility
--------------------

All cameras supported by the `zed ros2 wrapper <https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper>`_ work with Isaac ROS.

Setup Instructions
------------------

.. note::

  This tutorial assumes that you have set up your development environment by following the instructions :doc:`here </getting_started/dev_env_setup>`.

1. Clone the ``zed-ros2-wrapper`` repository on the ``master`` branch:

  .. code:: bash

      cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src && \
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper

2. If you are using ZED X or ZED X Mini refer to the appropriate `stereolabs setup guide <https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/get-started-with-zed-x/>`_.

  .. note::
    You do **not** need to install the ``ZED SDK`` because this is done in Step 5 of Setup Instructions.

  .. note::
    You must install the ``ZED driver``.


3. Plug in the USB cable of your ZED camera before launching the Docker container in the next step.

4. Launch the Docker container.

  .. code:: bash

    cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common && \
    ./scripts/run_dev.sh

5. Install the ``ZED SDK``.

  .. note::
    Use ``install-zed-x86_64.sh`` below if you are running on X86.
  .. code:: bash

    sudo chmod +x ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common/docker/scripts/install-zed-aarch64.sh && \
    ${ISAAC_ROS_WS}/src/isaac_ros_common/docker/scripts/install-zed-aarch64.sh

6. Install the dependencies for the ``zed_wrapper`` package and build it:

  .. code:: bash

      cd ${ISAAC_ROS_WS} && \
      sudo apt update && \
      rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths src/zed-ros2-wrapper --ignore-src -r -y && \
      colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to zed_wrapper

7. After the container image is rebuilt and you are inside the container, you can run ``/usr/local/zed/tools/ZED_Explorer`` to check that the ZED camera is connected.

  .. code:: bash

    /usr/local/zed/tools/ZED_Explorer

  If everything is working as expected, you should see something similar to the following:
