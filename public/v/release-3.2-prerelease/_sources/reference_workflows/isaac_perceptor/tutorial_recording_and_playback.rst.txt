This tutorial guides you through the steps to record and playback data for `Isaac Perceptor`.

    .. note::

        You must run on a hardware platform equipped with `Nova Orin Developer Kit` to record data
        compatible with `Isaac Perceptor`.


Recording Data for `Isaac Perceptor`
------------------------------------

To record data for use in the `Running from a ROSbag` tutorial below, we use
the :doc:`isaac_ros_nova_recorder </repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nova/isaac_ros_nova_recorder/index>`,
which is part of :ir_repo:`Isaac ROS Nova <isaac_ros_nova>` repository.

To generate the required data:

1. Follow the installation instructions in
:ref:`Isaac ROS Nova Recorder Quickstart <repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nova/isaac_ros_nova_recorder/index:quickstart>`.

2. Please use :ir_repo:`hawk-3.yaml <isaac_ros_nova> <isaac_ros_nova/config/hawk-3.yaml>` configuration for recording data with the `Nova Orin Developer`.
This configures the recorder to record only the front, left, and right Hawk stereo cameras.

    .. code:: bash

        ros2 launch isaac_ros_nova_recorder nova_recorder.launch.py config:=hawk-3

Use :ir_repo:`nova-carter_hawk-4.yaml <isaac_ros_nova> <isaac_ros_nova/config/nova-carter_hawk-4.yaml>` for recording data with the `Nova Carter`.
This configures the recorder to record the front, left, right, and back Hawk stereo cameras.

    .. code:: bash

        ros2 launch isaac_ros_nova_recorder nova_recorder.launch.py config:=nova-carter_hawk-4

3. Follow steps 2 through 6 from :ref:`Run Launch File <isaac-ros-nova-recorder-launch>`.

By default, the resulting data  is saved under ``/mnt/nova_ssd/recordings``. It can be used to
generate a reconstruction using the `Running from a ROSbag` tutorial described below.


Running from a ROSbag
---------------------

Downloading Pre-recorded Data (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can run `Isaac Perceptor` on the a pre-recorded ROSbag from `Nova Carter`.

1. Download ``r2b_galileo`` dataset from the `r2b 2024 dataset on NGC <https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/isaac/resources/r2bdataset2024>`__.

2. Place the dataset at ``$ISAAC_ROS_WS/isaac_ros_assets/r2b_2024/r2b_galileo``.

Launching `Isaac Perceptor`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    Complete either
    :doc:`Tutorial: Running Camera-based 3D Perception with Isaac Perceptor on Nova Orin Developer Kit</reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/tutorials_on_devkit/demo_perceptor>`
    or
    :doc:`Tutorial: Running Camera-based 3D Perception with Isaac Perceptor on Nova Carter</reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/tutorials_on_carter/demo_perceptor>`. 
    You must have set up the prerequisites, launched `Isaac Perceptor` application,
    and obtained object detection and visual odometry visualizations.

If you want to run the `Isaac Perceptor` from a ROSbag (rather than streaming from sensors),
you may use the ``rosbag`` argument.

If your ROSbag is recorded on `Nova Orin Developer Kit`, you can launch the app as:

.. code:: bash

    ros2 launch nova_developer_kit_bringup perceptor.launch.py mode:=rosbag rosbag:=<YOUR_ROSBAG_PATH>

If your ROSbag is recorded on `Nova Carter`, you can launch the app as:

.. code:: bash

    ros2 launch nova_carter_bringup perceptor.launch.py mode:=rosbag rosbag:=<YOUR_ROSBAG_PATH>

If you are using the pre-recorded ROSbag, you can run:

.. code:: bash

    ros2 launch nova_carter_bringup perceptor.launch.py \
        stereo_camera_configuration:=front_left_right_configuration \
        mode:=rosbag \
        rosbag:=$ISAAC_ROS_WS/isaac_ros_assets/r2b_2024/r2b_galileo


Visualizing the Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Proceed to the Foxglove studio to visualize sensor outputs and mesh of surround environments.
If your ROSbag is recorded on `Nova Orin Developer Kit`, follow similar steps in
:ref:`Visualizing the Outputs from Isaac Perceptor on Nova Orin Developer Kit <reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/tutorials_on_devkit/demo_perceptor:Visualizing the Outputs>`.
If your ROSbag is recorded on `Nova Carter`, follow
:ref:`Visualizing the Outputs from Isaac Perceptor on Nova Carter <reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/tutorials_on_carter/demo_perceptor:Visualizing the Outputs>`.
