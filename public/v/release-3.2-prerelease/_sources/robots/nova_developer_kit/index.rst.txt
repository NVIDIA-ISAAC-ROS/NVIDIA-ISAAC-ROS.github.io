The `Nova Orin Developer Kit` provides for streamlined testing of the Nova sensor suite and Isaac ROS.

The `Nova Orin Developer Kit` is powered by a Jetson AGX Orin with additional interface I|O boards
developed for robotics; it includes:

* 3x `HAWK stereo cameras <https://leopardimaging.com/leopard-imaging-hawk-stereo-camera/>`__ (1920x1200, 60 FPS, 120° FOV)
* 3x `OWL fisheye cameras <https://leopardimaging.com/product/autonomous-camera/maxim-gmsl2-cameras/li-ar0234cs-gmsl2-owl/li-ar0234cs-gmsl2-owl/>`__ (1920x1200, 120 FPS, 202°± 3° FOV)
* IMU, Magnetometer, and Barometer

The `Nova Orin Developer Kit` allows high-precision time synchronization between
sensors using hardware time stamping, and PTP over Ethernet with less than 10us
for sensor acquisition time. The robot provides simultaneous camera capture
across all cameras within 100us from a single hardware trigger, and can write to
disk at 4 GB per second for sensor capture to ROSbags.

Tutorials
---------

Once you set up `Nova Orin Developer Kit` successfully, you are recommended to go through
:doc:`tutorials of running camera-based 3D perception </reference_workflows/isaac_perceptor/run_perceptor_on_devkit>`
to run, and evaluate :ref:`isaac_perceptor` on the `Nova Orin Developer Kit`, which could be mounted
on your robot.
