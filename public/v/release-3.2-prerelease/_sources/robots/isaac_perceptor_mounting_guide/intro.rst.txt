Sensor Mounting Guide Introduction
----------------------------------

Scope
^^^^^

This guide is intended for robotics enthusiasts and professionals who
want to integrate NVIDIA Nova Orin and NVIDIA Isaac software modules
into their products. NVIDIA Isaac software modules, such as Isaac
Perceptor, introduce vision-based artificial intelligence to tackle
perception challenges encountered by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)
that are operating in highly unstructured environments. These challenges
include robust odometry, depth perception, obstacle mapping,
localization and more.

NVIDIA Nova Orin is sensor and compute architecture based on NVIDIA Orin
System-on-Chip (SoC), for AMR applications. Nova is fully compatible
with Isaac software modules and can interface with other AMR
sub-systems.

By leveraging NVIDIA Nova hardware and NVIDIA Isaac software, customers
can rapidly deliver AMRs for their applications achieving the highest
levels of performance while cutting the engineering cost and mitigating
uncertainties.

In the Reference section of this chapter the reader will find a document
that explains how to build an NVIDIA Orin-based computer compatible with
Nova Orin architecture, as well as how to connect sensors described in
this document to the Orin-based computer. In this document the reader
will learn where to mount Nova sensors on a robot to be compatible with
Isaac software modules and to achieve optimal performance. However,
because the robotics market is very fragmental and robots' geometries
vary substantially from one application to another, there is no one
single sensor architecture that fits all. This guide demonstrates in
detail two very different sensor architectures - one for a top-carrier
robot and another for a reach forklift. The guide provides sensor
coverage requirements which are not tightly coupled to the specific
robot geometry as well as mounting position and orientation envelopes.
We hope that by reading these examples and requirements, the reader will
be able to devise optimal sensor architecture for their specific
application.
