Nova Carter
===========

`Nova Carter <https://robotics.segway.com/nova-carter/>`__ was jointly developed
with `Segway Robotics <https://robotics.segway.com/>`__, for autonomous robotics
development including accelerated computing for ROS 2 with full 360° sensing
from camera and LIDAR and validated by `Open Navigation
<https://www.opennav.org/>`__ for use with Nav2.

`Nova Carter` is powered by a Jetson AGX Orin with additional interface I|O boards
developed for robotics; it includes

* 1x 32 beam 360° LIDAR
* 2x planar LIDARs
* 4x `HAWK stereo cameras <https://leopardimaging.com/leopard-imaging-hawk-stereo-camera/>`__ (1920x1200, 60 FPS, 120° FOV)
* 4x `OWL fisheye cameras <https://leopardimaging.com/product/autonomous-camera/maxim-gmsl2-cameras/li-ar0234cs-gmsl2-owl/li-ar0234cs-gmsl2-owl/>`__ (1920x1200, 120 FPS, 202°± 3° FOV)
* IMU, Magnetometer, and Barometer

`Nova Carter` allows high-precision time synchronization between sensors using
hardware time stamping, and PTP over Ethernet with less than 10us for sensor
acquisition time. The robot provides simultaneous camera capture across all
cameras within 100us from a single hardware trigger, and can write to disk at 4
GB per second for sensor capture to ROSbags.

`Nova Carter` robots running Isaac ROS can be teleoperated, map an environment,
and navigate within that environment using visual cameras and LiDARs.
