Isaac ROS Buildfarm
===================

NVIDIA Jetson platforms run on JetPack OS which is based on Ubuntu Linux. JetPack 5.x is
built on top of Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, meaning that Debian packages for ROS 2 Humble 
built by the ROS 2 Buildfarm for Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy are unsupported. 

Since the official ROS 2 Buildfarm only builds for Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy, 
the Isaac ROS Buildfarm is setup to build ROS 2 packages from source for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal.

Setup
-----

The Isaac ROS Buildfarm is a fork of the official Buildfarm with several modifications to build
nearly all ROS 2 packages for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal. NVIDIA's semi-global CDN distributes these 
community-contributed packages and soon prebuilt Isaac ROS Debian packages.

To setup the CDN as an apt source, perform the following steps:

Set Locale
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: shell

   locale  # check for UTF-8

   sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
   sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
   sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

   locale  # verify settings

Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt update && sudo apt install gnupg wget
   sudo apt install software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository universe

Setup Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, register the GPG key with ``apt``. Two options are listed below, one
for ``.com`` (US CDN) and one for ``.cn`` (China CDN) - choose whichever you
prefer.

.. code:: shell

   wget -qO - https://isaac.download.nvidia.com/isaac-ros/repos.key | sudo apt-key add -

.. code:: shell

   wget -qO - https://isaac.download.nvidia.cn/isaac-ros/repos.key | sudo apt-key add -

Now add the repository to your ``apt`` sources.

.. code:: shell

   echo 'deb https://isaac.download.nvidia.com/isaac-ros/ubuntu/main focal main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

.. code:: shell

   echo 'deb https://isaac.download.nvidia.cn/isaac-ros/ubuntu/main focal main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

Next, for all non-Buildfarm ROS 2 packages, ensure you have the ROS 2 apt repository sourced.

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y \
   && sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

.. code:: shell

   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

This should allow for as-normal installation of almost all ROS 2
packages. We guarantee support for any ROS 2 packages on which Isaac ROS
is dependent.

Install ROS 2 Packages
----------------------

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt update

Per ROS 2 documentation:

Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop

and/or

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop-full

ROS-Base Install (Bare Bones): Communication libraries, message
packages, command line tools. No GUI tools.

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base

Development tools: Compilers and other tools to build ROS packages

.. code:: shell

   sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
