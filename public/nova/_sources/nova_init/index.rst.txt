Nova Orin Init
==============

Nova Orin Init is a Debian package that includes drivers, device trees, system services, configurations, and tools provided for users to start working on robotics software on Jetson Orin.

Install
-------

:nova_apt:

Install Nova.

#. Update APT and install the Debian:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install nova-orin-init

#. Verify that you see an output similar to the following, if this is your first time doing the install:

   .. code-block::
      :class: no-copybutton, wrap-block

      No Nova YAML specified. The following example files are available: none, hawk-2_owl-4, owl-4, nova-devkit, nova-orin, hawk-1, hawk-4_owl-4, hawk-2, nova-carter. Select one of the examples for a predefined yaml or none if you would like to write your own custom. Use `show <example>` if you want to see the YAML. Response:

   The examples provided are either products (``nova-devkit``, ``nova-carter``, etc.) related to Nova or configurations commonly used on a Jetson with Nova. Examples ``hawk-1``, ``owl-4``, ``hawk-4_owl-4``, etc., are named after the type of sensors Nova expects are connected to the Jetson. For instance, if there is only 1 Hawk connected to the Jetson the ``hawk-1`` YAML should be selected. Not all configurations have examples, if no example suits your configuration add your own custom YAML by selecting ``none`` and following the :ref:`guide here <getting_started/platforms/adapting_nova:customizing nova>`.

   Continue if no question appears. No question means that it's using the old config on the Nova platform.

#. Reboot the platform by pressing the power button or running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo reboot

#. Verify that sensors are working by running the :doc:`PFC</tools/pfc>`.
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      nova_preflight_checker

Upgrade
-------

#. Upgrade using the apt repository.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt update && sudo apt install nova-orin-init

#. Reboot the platform by pressing the power button or running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo reboot

#. Verify that sensors are working by running the :doc:`PFC</tools/pfc>`.
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      nova_preflight_checker

Uninstall
---------

#. Remove the Debian:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt remove nova-orin-init
   
   The removal of Nova Orin Init attempts to revert all settings to their original state on the
   robot.

#. Reboot the platform by pressing the power button or running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo reboot

Remove Previous Selection
-------------------------

During Nova Orin Init install it asks for a Nova YAML selection. This selection persists between installs and automates the upgrade process for your Nova YAML. If you would like to change your Nova YAML follow the instructions below.

#. Remove Nova Orin Init and its previous selection.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt remove nova-orin-init
      sudo rm /etc/nova/manager_selection

#. (Optional) Remove the custom YAML you created if ``none`` was selected previously during install.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo rm /etc/nova/setup.yaml

Add Real-Time Support
---------------------

Real-time capabilities can be added to any Jetson AGX Orin with JP6 GA by following the `installing real-time guide provided by Jetpack <https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r36.4/DeveloperGuide/SD/Kernel/KernelCustomization.html?real-time-kernel-using-ota-update#real-time-kernel-using-ota-update>`__. This is useful for applications like robotic arms.

Nova Orin Init does not currently support real-time by default it must be modified after every installation/upgrade. To support real-time the system must use the real-time image. Run the following commands to update Nova's boot config to use the real-time image:

.. note::

   The Jetpack real-time guide must be completed and Nova Orin Init must be installed before running the below commands

.. code-block::

   sudo sed -i '/LABEL JetsonIO/,/APPEND/ s|LINUX /boot/Image|LINUX /boot/Image.real-time|' "/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf"
