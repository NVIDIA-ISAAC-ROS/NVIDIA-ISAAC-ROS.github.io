Nova Orin Init 1.3.2
--------------------

The Nova Orin Init 1.3.2 release corresponds with Isaac ROS 3.2. Release ``>=`` 1.3.2 supports JP6.1 and JP6.2. For JP6.0 support use ``<=`` 1.3.1. This release focuses on improving the architecture for Nova Manager and Nova Preflight Checker to make them more adaptable/extensible for the user.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nova Orin Init release 1.3.2:

- Overhaul Nova Preflight Checker to integrate with ``pytest`` better and make it easier for users to add their own ``pytest`` tests
- Restructure Nova Manager and add arguments to introspect into Nova modules (``--list-modules``, ``--dry-run``, ``--list-modules-tree``)
- The ``systeminfo.yaml`` file explicitly states all modules that have been enabled on the system
- ``systeminfo.yaml`` has a reserved field ``name`` for identifying its use case
- Add Segway charging status to ``nova_battery_status``
- Prevent PFC from running after boot until prerequisites are met
- Network interfaces for LIDARs use standard Ubuntu naming scheme ``eno1`` instead of ``eth0``
- Tools (``print_eeprom``, ``print_battery_status``, etc.) have moved from the tools folder to their respective modules
- Programmable Vision Accelerator (PVA) module added to enable it for use by default
- ``jtop`` module added to enable it as a tool by default
- PHC<->TSC latch is now monitored and set again if it is reset
- More PFC tests (SSD speed, Hesai return mode, etc.)
- Minor bug fixes to PFC and Nova Manager
